! Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers that lined empty-halls

15 Minutes past the Bell
That point-of-no-return to class

Any student this late would get writ-up
Ironically worse than not-arriving-at-all

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail

His purpose was in the basement
To the door he planned to open

Latency becomes mounted by endless-anticipation
That energy from day-dreaming now as a hurdle
Aun compelled him towards the opposite direction

The thump of Todd's feet steady
Step after step up stairs to higher floors

It was a peace appreciated
In a place only-ever bustling-loudly

The few rays of the sun
Bore thru only to show
Dust pollute'n the air
_

The mellow ambience shattered as
Patters of run'n feet charged towards his direction
From around the corner

Fortune had placed Todd
Directly opposite of the girls restroom

The distance was leapt in one bound
He rushed to the last stall

Todd let out a cocky smirk
Of the ingenuity of hiding in the girls

!! KAK

The cracked-seat broke plunging his left-foot ankle-deep into hour-old piss & shit
He caught his balance with his arms to save the other foot

The door quietly opened
Someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled yell came from the hallway
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

!! BOOM

Heavy legs near-cracked-the-door-in-half

That unexpected fright broke unprecedented-pressure into full-release

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSPPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP

The entire school vibrated
With the overwhelming sound
Of a prolonged-volcano-blast

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN YOU SHOULDA SAID WHY
!!! YOU NEEDED THE GIRLS

One of the schoolhall-monitors hooted out for-the-entire-building-to-know

The last of this announcement was gagged-quiet as gas particles bloomed-out in a thick cloud
_

The room was silent after the door fell shut and resettled
The building now rumbled giggling

!! PAT
!! PAT
!! PAT

Ben kicked at the stall door braced-shut by legs
'Gonna make your fat-cunt-ass
'Eat that shit you scabby bitch

Todd stepped out of the stall
'Back off

Ben turned to him even more crazed

!YOU

Todd was tackled to the wall
Slamming hard as his wet foot slipped out

Ben muffled as he struggled out his revenge
'You are the reason I got chased

'walk'n around
'like you weren't skipping class

'a teacher notified
'the monitors and got me chased down

Todd maneuvered around using Ben's force against him
Then with his forearms placed Ben in a locked-hold

After several curses
And a long pause
Ben surrendered
'Alright asshole
'You made your point

Todd pushed Ben off to a safe distance
A toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that
Jordan blushed-out the awkward introduction
'Im sick

Today would haunt Ben's reputation a long time
For a while they were content with breathing the compressed-gas in silence
_

Walls washed white layer-after-layer
Extenuated by the dark recesses between the tiles
Unable to conceal the deep-red of the graffiti symbols
That were easily-visible when seen-as-a-whole

Piss marked all to a feminine territory
If only the stain
But mostly the smell

Curiosity here only met horrors
Ben broke the silence

'This place is kinda creepy

All of them had been repelled from investigations

Hot-box-gassed-up
No where to go until the class period ended

A sound tickled Todd's ear
It had an enchanting burr to the tail-ends of the echoes

It drew him closer to the wall
Before he realized he was interested

Todd was startled then reaffirmed

'There is a hum
'That sounds like a whimper
'Can you guys hear it

Jordan put in as he neared
'Probably a ghost

He yelled at the trash-can playfully
'This school is hella-haunted
'sk-a-dick Bettsy burns-the-dick-off

The rust smeared as Todd opened the lid for better acoustics

Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

( need help help please help )

The sound came softened from great distance
But with a fullness-of-scream
That rips apart throat-lining

The communication so faint
Todd looked to the others for confirmation

( help us    please )

Jordan ventured
'Here
'we are here
'Where are you

( can you hear me  hello please help )

Jordan continued
'We hear you
'We will get the Principal

( noooooooooooo ! )

The shriek took all three back in a tight terror
Pitch-to-curl-ear-hairs in absolute revolution

( they did this to her! )

Todd opened the lid with both his hands to shout down

'Who ever you are
'Where ever you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately
The others followed dazed

To them it seemed
A reckless promise

At 10-min-to-the-bell
The hall is at its most empty
Policy prohibits anyone out-in-the-hall

The trio made their way without obstruction
The Monitors would be back in their lounge on the couch

'I discovered a secret door
'When I got lost my first-year fire-drill

'All year I been trying to work myself
'Up to this before graduation

'No chance ever came
'So today I promised
'I would make it happen

Todd was the only-one-he-knew
Who had seen that long-corridor

Despite years he still believed in what he had seen

'I since first-year
'Been dreaming about exploring it

'Today is too much for coincidence
'That door will lead us there

The three boys followed the stairwells down
A small pack not-to-be-fucked-with

On-the-move breaking all violations
They were all-in since they left the girls

Crossed lengths of halls
Of the first year students

Todd continued
'When I got lost

'I felt someone calling out to me by-name
'I followed
'Tho less-than-a-handful knew my name

'I found a door at the end of the hall
'It was unlocked
'At first I only peaked in out of curiosity

'At the back of the closet
'There was a light-source instead of shadow

'I had time to wander

'I went to the back to see a long corridor

'The path went on for a long time
'It ended at a black hole in a wall

'I am sure it leads down
'But I forced myself to go back
'Before I got near enough to know

'Goddam-creepy-place

Todd looked ahead determined
The pent-up-forces now-unleashed
Propelled him forward unstoppable

Thru the hall in the basement
The moved around windows
One-at-a-time ninja-like

Till they got
Near the gym-lockers

Jordan expounded
Stirred with the brisk walk

'Sheit-man all my papers for school
'Were all about school
'Lame-as-fk bro

'Yo tho the one
'Caught me like

! daymn

'In the library
'People all WTF

'Got kicked out of the library that time
'& There was a god-damn blizzard outside

'Ohyeahtho
'That project got me on this newspaper

'Bored, but try'n to look like
'I wasn't only here for the roof

'So Im go'n thru all these papers from the start
'To see when Driscol got famous the first time

'This floor is supposed to be the basement
'Right so with that-in-mind

'There was one article
'It would blow-your-mind man

'A boy found pieced-up
'In a fishy satanic ritual

'Im like some lil muthrfkr
'Put this pulp in tryna-act-smart

'But !Daymn
'It was page legit
'Democracy's most prominent paper

'The article had said the janitor alerted authorities from across the county
'They almost hung-up as nutt-case

'But the they heard him
'Get eaten alive
'Fleshy sounds & munch'n & shit

'The go all PoPo from-the-sector at the place
'They could hear over a hundred in the cult

'The Recession took his home & he slept at school
'& He got all eaten-alive & shit

'But yeah man that shit all happened
'On the muthrfkn-third-basement floor

'I thought it was a typo caz there is only one basement
'But like I said I've had to do school-research all the damn time

'This building was only two floors for more than a decade later
'When the Uni was built over us

'I tried to correspond
'But nah nothing man

'We are talking total-silence as in
'Newspapers from that entire month
'All gone missing

'Sheit that archive I was on was national

They were panting hard having crossed three-floors

Ben countered at the steamroll-logic
'I been here all 3 years of school

'If there were multi-basement-levels
'There would be some proof

'A reworked stairwell
'Modified to only move up

'I been in both those classrooms first year
'Those walls are as old as Miss Finely

'may-the-cunt-bitch-rest-in-peace

'There would be left structural pillars
'With three basements those pillars
'Cant just be erased off the structure

'I mean fk
'All of our classroom-ceilings
'Look all mangled-patchwork
'From the Uni

Ben's logic was solid
But life seldom follows logic

'You both believe that a stairwell could just disappear
'These stairwells were created by god on the 8th-day for fks-sake
_

The exterior wall was at the far-end
In the corner that held a closet door

Todd's sweaty palms slid on the locked knob
A narrow closet was exposed by the small window

'I-got-it
Jordan knelt in front
Took off his pack
Retrieved a pouch

The door was open and pack back on Jordan's back
Before the other two could follow the action

Once inside the back after the brooms & mops
A corridor was revealed to turn down a very-long-hallway

The narrow corridor
Followed the exterior wall

Single-file in the errie-way of knowing
An action would change life forever

Ben said as endorphins flowed
In bounty of an oft asked question

'I always thought it was odd that there were no small windows
'In any of the rooms on the basement

'So this is the real outer wall

'The Fire Marshall got he school on fire-code
'Rather than expose this wall

'They rather built that new northside-stairwell
'Whole week the Firemen escort'd people up to the hospital

The walls made of the pilgrim-old-brick
Large & thick & dark-purple
_

The tunnel was bare
It held no purpose
No back doors to any classrooms

It only continued
Long-passage-after-long-passage

The end came up abruptly
As a blank wall

Ben chirp'd
'The architect must have been a comedian

Jordan countered
'Or a way to hide access
'To an entire level in a closet

'Back in the day
'The bay was too huge

'Before all them rich-people
'Bought up all the bayside

'This was a scary place to live
'Everyone with guns & knives

'Pirates raided every year
'Roy Miller's Path
'Arcs right where the school is
'This is as far as they ever went
'Often to kidnapped kids

'That's why we have that motto

'Once a Buc
'Always a Fk

Ben thought he knew alot about the school
But he only vaguely heard people talk of what Jordan said

Ben noticed on the old bricks
Symbols carved in peculiar diagrams
The sprawl of it was typical of angry graffiti

Todd had been busy searching
For the door having arrived
Upon only a blank wall
There was no way
This part of the memory false

Todd's nails scraped against the wall
Along a fine-line found only after difficulty

Jordan moved him out of the way
& Went to work with a thin steel bar

Peeled-paint revealed a metal door
2ft above-the-ground 3ft high-and-wide

'Sheiit

'We get caught back here
'Gonna be there screaming ourselves
'Best-recognize

'Might as well go all-in
'Right from the start

Jordan patted his bar on palm confidently

Todd took the bar from Jordan
'Maybe I should hold onto that

Jordan only looked onto his hand
He felt completely betrayed by it

Jordan raised an eyebrow
Only content to let Todd do the rest of the work

They all helped
Pry the hinges into creaked-submission

Somehow Todd always knew this went down
Now he saw into the black depths

The door had the lock from the inside
The fall of it down the shaft shaft
Tinkled bangs for a long long time

'Pilgrims were paranoid muthrfkrs

Ben looked at Jordan
'Wouldn't you be

Jordan smirked back

? Be

'Hell Im worse
'My locks dont bend
_

Dark musty air flowed immediately to them
Strong-as-a-gulf-breeze
Hot as furnace vent

Something caught Todd's eye
He poked at it with the bar

Elevator-cords hung in the mid
Hidden by darkness

'If there are 3 lower basements
'Then there are two floors to explore

An exchange of glances agreed compliance

Jordan looked casual
Ben looked like he would not back down

Todd reached with extended-arm and grasped the cord
In a hard pull he let himself be drawn into the darkness

He left them with a confident smirk
He was prepared for this

Todd's hands began to slide
It was only a lurch
His heart ever-thankful

He lowered his hand to slip
Rapidly descending screaming

!!! HAILMARYFULLOFGRACE
_

All was dark
Distance only an abstract measurement

Movement only testified by the-burning-of-his-palms
Sweat-sprung as will-fought-for-life

Todd ventured his legs out
He managed to stop himself into near splits

!!! TODD

The other two screamed frantically down

Todd looked up
The door only a small smudge of silver
In the infinity of dark space


'Im okay
'Im okay

'There is oil on the cords
'I should have expected it

'Gonna take off my shirt
'Use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

Ben asked automatically
Without idea on how to back up the offer
'Do you need help up

Todd fearless began to climb at a controlled rate
'Its best only one person
'Be on the cord at the same time

'Im gonna try
'To find a door
'To get to one of the floors
'I fell pretty far
'So Im guess'n up

Skin-peel-palms grateful-past-pain
For the cool protection of the shirt
_

Todd didn't notice any doors
In the commotion down

The best course would be to climb up slowly
To ensure he could get back up

He would feel for an open'n with this feet

The slide down had cleared off most of the oil
His covered-hands now had clean purchase

The only sound was his breath
And the swell of air

The gusts came intense
Rising with the heat-from-deep-darkness

Todd felt a gust on his stomach
It was cool & didn't come from below
He stomped out the outline of the door

! TWANG
! TWANG

A beam bore into the darkness

'I think

! I found it

With one hand he felt for a handle
The door was there, he could feel the cold metal

!! POMP
!! POMP

Todd stomped the corner down
He pulled himself higher
Kicking-down until the door gave way

He pulled himself into the dusty grey hallway

'I'm off the cords
'Come down

'Wrap your shirt around your hands
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Jordan challenged
'Best just stay back
'Something get loose and fall
'Right into your face

Ben & Jordan followed down and swiftly entered

Ben, last, climbed inside scraping his knee
Looking up saw Todd and shrieked back falling-on-his-ass

! FUCK

Todd was covered in dusk-caked dark-blood-mud
Blood not oil had been on the cords

Smears were left where Todd had touched himself
Jordan hadn't taken much notice of it

The sub-basement had no light
But the sliver of the dust
Seemed to repeat any up
What available light there was
_

This level was an abandoned hospital
All lay as if it had been unexpectedly sealed off

Dust caked everywhere
Jordan could easily see their tracks back

They went forward in a cautious manner of adventure

Electricity still flowed on this floor
Emergency signs gave enough light for them to move secure

Ben told them
'That shaft went way past the length of the building

'This must be where they deposit all the bodies from the hospital
'But that explanation doesn't make much sense

Jordan continued
'It doesn't make much sense
'To have a hospital as a secret basement

'More like a fkn-mid-Evil-sex-dungeon
'where-bad-kids-go-krumpus

At the end of the first hall
Jordan looked into a room

On the bed was a familiar form

'Hold up

Jordan walked inside the room
Only a bed pan & a flipped-over bed
With a swift fling he threw off the blanket

A long decayed corpse lay there turnt-off the-fallen-bed
The smell stung their noses sweetly

The horror was simple
No screams or fear of life

Only a complete confidence
Their life was in danger
_

A loud-clang, shuffle and meaty-wacks where heard
A hoarse voice rose but was immediately silenced

The boys took shelter in the room
A corpse for company

The day had long-since
Numbed their nostrils

Jordan whispered
'Doesn't make sense
'Water from the tap
'Electricity

Ben
! Snap

He took off his pack
Using the blanket as tent

Plugged into power
Plugged into a raw-network

Jordan & Todd
Both the third-wheel

Rather look at the corpse
Neither help touch it to make a tent

Its hair over-grown
Its jaw dangled stoopidly

Its hollow eyes
Held a truth
Mystery to present company

Someone was trapped & beaten
In the concealed sub-basement of the school

The authorities would no-doubt
Do likewise to the trio of boys

In an abandoned level
Layers from escape

With only one known exit
An elevator shaft

Mousecraft
The sure way to go about these things

Patience & long-wait'n
Until absolute vacancy was established

Jordan an expert in this situation

For the entire period they waited
Bells could still be faintly-heard

The silence was a time of meditation

Accept the drastic turn of this Friday morn

Be ready to decide
Upon actions with dire-consequences
_

Their eyes & senses
Now accustomed they proceeded

Halls built in the same hight-cieling-structure of their school
One large hall circled the outside rooms & inner rooms

All told obvious signs
This area-of-the-basement was not used

Jordan guided their search
He tracked the dust
To know how long since last-passage

The inside of rooms
The highest-end in the vacancy-spectrum:

Untouched -> long-since -> this-month -> this-week -> today
_

Jordan now on a path
That was taken daily

One head-of-the-path
Led to a stairwell

They followed the other head
Towards a large-open-room inner-room

It dropped low
Into a deep arena

Workstations arrayed the entire space

Industrial-lamps draped
Over each stone table

Shiny-rungs glinted
Embedded as obvious restraint ports

Under each table
Various shelves
For various instruments

Jordan's heart fainted

All the tools
In all the stations
Down all the rows
Had-been-used-recently

This month for a massive operation

The only daily path led
To a table at center-stage
The only table with its light on

Strapped to the table by a broad-leather-belt
Was a nude-red-headed-girl

So bruised was her face
Impossible to see her freckles

Freckles covered her entire body
Freckled to the point that

Tho bloody, bruised & nude
All only the second characteristic noticed

First the infinite amount of cherry-colored-dots

She had stich-patch-openings all over her torso
Patches appeared in similar fashion all over her body

Her shut-eyes sprang into maniacal-alertness

Two large yellow-orbs

Three boys, not monsters, stood over her

Jordan was unable to free any strap
'How do we get these loose

Confused past-exasperated

'How
!daFKget
'These god-damn-straps-off

Yelling stupidly at the world
But really aimed at the girl

Entirely realizing
How idiotically loud he was

She screamed just recently
Now she won't speak to save her tail

Jewels looked back at him

She opened displaying
A mutilated-stump-of-a-tongue-in-a-wag

The stump was fresh
It had an odd-seal as if it was seared

A small muffled voice came to fullness
'Finally sorry
'I could not speak
'Hardly-breathe
'When she lays like that

'Don't you move like that neanderthal
'I need to get ready to introduce us
'A hundred years will teach you patience bitch

Infantile hands pushed its way out of a tangle of hair
A creature emerged from her shoulder

A shrunken-head
Two baby-arms attached
Under the shriveled-ears
_

The trio looked aghast

The girl
Had a monster perched on her shoulder

'Yes this is a shock
'I understand ignorance
The little head said in a small voice

Jewels cast her face-to-the-side-ashamed

Nude & openly disfigured
Took over her predicament as most-painful

The little head made a-small-exasperated-sound
'How are you such a bitch all the time
'I can find you a new-tongue
'A longer one if you are into-that
'You had much worse now no need to disrespect me
'Miss the Countess for-fucks-sake

Jordan leant in between the two
! we-gotta-get-the-fk-outta-dodge

'The bands are one leather belt
'Hurry up
'There is not a second to spare
The head said quietly

'Above our head you can release it
'Come on you rats

'Jewels can't speak now
'& I can't read her mind
'But I can sense what she is feeling

'She feels ashamed of me right now
The puppeted-head trailed on

Jordan found the clasp to be odd-shaped
Only after some ingenuity was it released

Only with the help
Of the metal bar and 6 arms

Jordan's shirt was the least dirty
Jewels wore it as a small dress
Miss had them make a measurement & a cut
To tailor the shirt to mold to her-form

The demeanor of Miss
Had an instant way
To blind the truth
& Interact like adult

Ben's shoes didn't fit Jewels
Only his socks

'We need to hurry
'If they come back soon
'Each one of us will be strapped
'All the worse for let

Promptly they made exodus
Out that devilish auditorium

The light had a cruel elderly-tint-of-aged-desperation
The rays seemed to follow them in a-haunting-fashion as-if-pointing-direction
Vengeful that what they have accepted must be fated-true unto-all
_

The elevator-cord now clean enough to allow them quick-access back up to the basement

Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their predicament

Todd was smeared over in blood
Thin-streams ran down his face like bloody-tears

Jordan was shirtless
His odd-shaped-belly budged-out

All were caked in dust

& Then there was Jewels

Ben admitted despair
'How the fk are we going to get out of school
'They are going to know where we have been immediately

'Put us back down here at all costs

Jordan wailed back
'Fk they will just say
'It was another goddamndrill

'That shit happens like every couple months

'I have a plan
Todd opened the closet door
And walked into the school hall

Dusty
Shirtless
Pantless
Bloody

They broke into the hall
Cast from horror

Sharply outlined
To a monotony-of-normal-scenes

The view more contrast
By their outlandish forms

Todd had a pre-planned route of exit

At the end of the hall
A teacher stopped her lecture
She opened the door and yelled

!!! MONITOR
!!! MONITOR SECTION 7

!!! 559

The call for all
To plaster against hall-windows
In a mosh-pit of greedy kids

Starving for 1st-hand-account
But only limited-viewing

Day-dreamt in revels
Of the earlier shit-show

Several girls touted
The hideous state
Of the toilet of the explosion
Some kid Ben had made
Who afterwards never found
As if he exploded instead of his ass

Up on lunch-meal-meds
Now in a riot
Each young-heart feral

The four spectated
Only by the larger-classmates

Todd led them around the corner
To rush up the stairwell

The teachers in this way
Were barred from looking out

Two large Monitors stood as sentinels
In locked-down-protocol at the-main-exit

!!! MONITORS
!!! SECTION 1

Two voices boomed

But Todd already turnt
Leading them up stairwells across the level

There was no time to explain
Only for Todd to choose and the rest to follow
_

Cross the school in this method
All Monitors would be drawn to the wrong location

Their exit was higher-up school-levels
Not at the ground-floor as expected
_

Every window filled
Every door blocked

Curious-children stirred by shouts
Starved-sight of the spectation
Charged by an eventful-day

Teachers more scared
Of the fight-pits
Than their duty

This factor allowed them
To the second-floor unhindered

Several kids were later
Taken up & hospitalized

Odd how an event
Only sparks a greater event

That riot burned
In hearts of the youth
_

Jordan pulled out his bar
'This-deep-in-it
'Now is the reckoning

'Suggest you wake-up likewise

Ben took the hint
He had a second-purpose for his laptop-computer

They passed the restroom of the morn
Towards the end of the hall

Todd took out a key from his pocket
He unlocked the window

'Just do what I do
'Go where I go

They climbed out onto a narrow ledge
The sun shone hotly on them
They burned under it with exhaustion

The world around them too-busy-with-the-day to notice
Four-odd-bodies outside on the second-story

The ledge continued to an adjacent roof
They crossed over to a high-branched tree

The branch overhung onto the roof in an entangled attachment

By that means they climbed down ground-level
At the back of the school

Onward into alleys
Towards less-traveled roads

Each of the boys knew how to pass-this-area without-being-seen
They ran tired but now they knew this-stage was their-turf

They knew over what fences led where
Up which buildings to what

Rat-true
Now they could not get caught

Jewels
Only had a large shirt & Ben's sweaty socks

Headed now by Jordan
The other too at her side

This kept her mostly covered

Large-city-bustlers continued their way without heed
The four moved as a pack following Jordan's lead
_

They arrived at the edge of Downtown
Outskirts to the industrial-sector

Jordan turned them into an alley
& Thru a chain-linked-fence hole
He loosed then bound-back

Thru a locked-window they quickly entered
The edifice as dusty as the sub-basement

They cautiously followed Jordan's movements

Hopping from board-to-board
Their trace with few tracks

Up the stairs to a room

Jordan locked the room with a chain after they entered
He then pushed away a cabinet to reveal another chain-locked door

'This far from anyone
'I like to be triple-sure so I can sleep

'Break'n thru one of these
'Loud enough to wake whatever sleep

An outside window exposed the endless ocean
Dust free & ocean breeze

Jordan led them thru the window
To a ledge that was covered by patched-tarps

The floor was of netted-metal
A repurposed fire-escape

'I got a tank of rain water
Jordan motioned with his hands

'Open the spout
'& Close it with this knob

Jordan motioned them to turn around

'It aint clear-water
'But cleaner than you

He took a brisk wash in water heated-by-the-sun
The water splashed far below

While waiting for Todd to finish
Ben asked Jordan
'So what is this place

He laid on the tatami

Jordan looked-down as his face blushed
'This is one of the places I go to live
_

Refreshed & completely exhausted

All laid on layers of
Cardboard-stitched japanese-tatami

Ocean gusts massaged their tense skin
All slept out-till-next-morn

In safe slumbers
Soothed by the-sound-of-steady-waves
_

They all woke in the daze
Of a new life

Jordan fed them dried fruit & granola
Desert was a Mtn-Dew

'Got locations like this
'City wide

'I can go any where
'And find myself alright in an hour

'Tho this one is the nicest
'Each has a stash of all I need

'Last week I was stuck across town
'I ate bad food I stashed I guess

Jordan finished looking apologetically at Ben
All that now mostly forgotten by the day

!fk

Ben realized his predicament with this father

His father would be ready with a self-righteous beating

It was Saturday morn
From Friday-morn to now
Seemed a trance he woken suddenly
_

Jordan trailed their exit
Covering their tracks as they returned to the streets

'Take everything
'I never go to the same place
'In the same week

Ben needed to get to the payphone at the lower-district Circle-K

The day was warming to be hot

The heat relaxed overworked-muscles
After a prolonged-stiff-sleep

Ben looked at Todd
'We only have enough for one call
'You mind if I use it

Todd complied
'I am the last of our litter
'My parents wouldn't know if I was gone for a week
_

Jordan had a rummage-of-clothes at that place
Raided from the downtown charity

Jewels was head-to-toe with garments that mostly fit
She had hiking-sandals with wool stockings
The light-blue summer-dress only-a-little-too-short

That morn her
& Miss the monster
Tailored the outfit
With repurposed-stockings for her forearms

Miss always held a finely-made extendable-umbrella
This would bar anyone from seeing what was quick-to-hide

Jordan now wore a pocketed vest

Ben took an old-leather-jacket he tied in a roll under his pack

Todd took a set of wool gloves for his hands

The shrunken head had stayed silent since their escape

It held the umbrella
'unoffended

The pressing pace of life left Jewels
Still to be sorted out
_

After 4 rings
Ben tried the oldman next-door

This wasn't the first time
This exact thing had happened

The old voice responded
'Heeh Hello

'Mr. Grinvix this is Ben
There was no response for some time

'I just wanted to call to ask about my dad
'He isn't answer'n the phone
'If you see him can you tell him I got a way home

Ben waited awkwardly
Only the sound of heavy breath'n

'Your dad
'is dead boy

'You best get to the authorities
'an have 'em tell ya

The voice was sympathetic but immediately hung up

Ben stood silent leaving the phone to his ear
Flabbergasted from truth-revealed-lie

? His dad would always be there

A jackass who tried hard to keep light of heart

To never-again hit him
Nor give him advice-no-other-could

Regretful of being a father
Who was stuck with a son

Man enough to power thru that hardship
That too-often-than-not he was the cause

Ben physically-worked to come-to-grips

Understandings toppled down
Dazed among rubble

The four in silence
Left him space to wail
_

!!! PLUUPP
!!! PLUPPP

A police car had silently snuck up behind the crew
Its lights now bright at their backs

'Alright you juuhhhh

The cop cut short as the pack immediately bolted

He turned & fumbled open the door
Which he preemptively shut

Today was not a mood
'Im gonna bust their diaphrams
'fkn-lil-shit-fks

The officer called into his shoulder-piece
'Broc here
'I got a 281 on that 48f
'Update the 48f is now a 49f

He reversed with sirens blaring
Confident he didn't need to look back

His focus-as-predator never dropping target

In that action he was fused
Into the building Circle-K

An overworked-trucker plowed
Backed by near a ton of Coca-Colas on trailer

An unstoppable mountain
Until about 15-feet in

Flesh crunched in sharp folds of metal
Soaking Dorito-chips like salsa
& Drowning the cop
In a cold-death of
Mountain-Dew Slurpee
_

Todd looked back in relief

That cop coming
Must have been the result
Of Ben calling his neighbor

The timing on the cop
Made sense if dispatched from Downtown-Station

What was this all about?
Did it have to do with Ben?
Or is this a result of yesterday?

The question caught his throat
Grateful many more steps
Still to take before an answer
