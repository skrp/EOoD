! Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers that lined empty-halls

15 Minutes past the Bell
That point-of-no-return to class

Any student this late would get writ-up
Ironically worse than not-arriving-at-all

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail

His purpose was in the basement
To the door he planned to open

Latency became mounted by endless-anticipation
Energy from day-dreaming now as a hurdle
Aun compelled him towards the opposite direction

The thump of Todd's feet steady
Step after step up stairs to higher floors

It was a peace appreciated
In a place only-ever bustling-loudly

The few rays of the sun
Bore thru only to expose
Dust-pollute'd air
_

The mellow ambience shattered
Patters of run'n feet charged towards his direction
From around the corner

Fortune had placed Todd
Directly opposite of the girls restroom

The distance was leapt in one bound
He rushed to the last stall

Todd let out a cocky smirk
Of the ingenuity of hiding in the girls

!! KAK

The cracked-seat broke plunging his left-foot ankle-deep into hour-old piss & shit
He caught his balance with his arms to save the other foot

The door quietly opened
Someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled yell came from the hallway
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

!! BOOM

Heavy-legs-kicking-open
Near-cracked-the-door-in-half

That unexpected fright broke unprecedented-pressure into full-release

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSPPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP

The entire school vibrated
With the overwhelming sound
Of a prolonged-volcano-blast

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN YOU SHOULDA SAID WHY
!!! YOU NEEDED THE GIRLS

One of the schoolhall-monitors hooted out for-the-entire-building-to-know

The last of this announcement was gagged-quiet as gas particles bloomed-out in a thick cloud
_

The room was silent after the door fell shut and resettled
The building now rumbled giggling

!! PAT
!! PAT
!! PAT

Ben kicked at the stall door braced-shut by legs
'Gonna make your fat-cunt-ass
'Eat that shit you scabby bitch

Todd stepped out of the stall
'Back off

Ben turned to him even more crazed

!YOU

Todd was tackled to the wall
Slamming hard as his wet foot slipped out

Ben muffled as he struggled out his revenge
'You are the reason I got chased

'walk'n around
'like you weren't skipping class

'a teacher notified
'the monitors and got me chased down

Todd maneuvered around using Ben's force against him
Then with his forearms placed Ben in a locked-hold

After several curses
And a long pause
Ben surrendered
'Alright asshole
'You made your point

Todd pushed Ben off to a safe distance
A toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that
Jordan blushed-out the awkward introduction
'Im sick

Today would haunt Ben's reputation a long time
For a while they were content with breathing the compressed-gas in silence
_

Walls washed white layer-after-layer
Extenuated by the dark recesses between the tiles
Unable to conceal the deep-red of the graffiti symbols
That were easily-visible when seen-as-a-whole

Piss marked all to a feminine territory
If only the stain
But mostly the smell

Curiosity here only met horrors
Ben broke the silence

'This place is kinda creepy

All repelled from investigations

Hot-box-gassed-up
No where to go
Until the class period ended

A sound tickled Todd's ear
It had an enchanting burr
To the tail-ends of the echoes

It drew him closer to the wall
Before he realized he was interested

Todd was startled then reaffirmed

'There is a hum
'That sounds like a whimper
'Can you guys hear it

Jordan put in as he neared
'Probably a ghost

He yelled at the trash-can playfully
'This school is hella-haunted
'sk-a-dick Bettsy burns-the-dick

The rust smeared as Todd opened the lid for better acoustics

Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

( need help help please help )

The sound came softened from great distance
But with a fullness-of-scream
That rips apart throat-lining

The communication so faint
Todd looked to the others for confirmation

( help us    please )

Jordan ventured
'Here
'we are here
'Where are you

( can you hear me  hello please help )

Jordan continued
'We hear you
'We will get the Principal

!!! nnnneeeeeeehhhhhhoooooooooooo

The shriek took all three back in a tight terror
Pitch-to-curl-ear-hairs in absolute revolution

...

( they did this )

Todd opened the lid with both his hands to shout down

'Who ever you are
'Where ever you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately
The others followed dazed

To them it seemed
A reckless promise

At 10-min-to-the-bell
The hall is at its most empty
Policy prohibits anyone out-in-the-hall

The trio made their way without obstruction
The Monitors would be back in their lounge on the couch

'I discovered a secret door
'When I got lost my first-year fire-drill

'All year I been trying to work myself
'Up to this before graduation

'No chance ever came
'So today I promised
'I would make it happen

Todd was the only-one-he-knew
Who had seen that long-corridor

Despite years he still believed in what he had seen

'I since first-year
'Been dreaming about exploring it

'Today is too much for coincidence
'That door will lead us there

The three boys followed the stairwells down
A small pack not-to-be-fucked-with

On-the-move breaking all violations
They were all-in since they left the girls

Crossed lengths of halls
Of the first year students

Todd continued
'When I got lost

'I felt someone calling out to me by-name
'I followed
'Tho less-than-a-handful knew my name

'I found a door at the end of the hall
'It was unlocked
'At first I only peaked in out of curiosity

'At the back of the closet
'There was a light-source instead of shadow

'I had time to wander

'I went to the back to see a long corridor

'The path went on for a long time
'It ended at a black hole in a wall

'I am sure it leads down
'But I forced myself to go back
'Before I got near enough to know

'Goddam-creepy-place

Todd looked ahead determined
The pent-up-forces now-unleashed
Propelled him forward unstoppable

Thru the hall in the basement
The moved around windows
One-at-a-time ninja-like

Till they got
Near the gym-lockers

Jordan expounded
Stirred with the brisk walk

'Sheit-man all my papers for school
'Were all about school
'Lame-as-fk bro

'Yo tho the one
'Caught me like

! daymn

'In the library
'People all WTF

'Got kicked out of the library that time
'& There was a god-damn blizzard outside

'Ohyeahtho
'That project got me on this newspaper

'Bored, but try'n to look like
'I wasn't only here for the roof

'So Im go'n thru all these papers from the start
'To see when Driscol got famous the first time

'This floor is supposed to be the basement
'Right so with that-in-mind

'There was one article
'It would blow-your-mind man

'A boy found pieced-up
'In a fishy satanic ritual

'Im like some lil muthrfkr
'Put this pulp in tryna-act-smart

'But !Daymn
'It was page legit
'Democracy's most prominent paper

'The article had said the janitor
'Alerted authorities from across the county
'They almost hung-up on him as nutt-case

'But the they heard him
'Get eaten alive
'Fleshy sounds & munch'n & shit
'Huge masses of people chanting

'All PoPo from-the-sector storme the place the place
'They could hear over a hundred in the cult

'The Recession took the janitor's home & he slept at school
'& He got all eaten-alive & shit

'But yeah man that shit all happened
'On the muthrfkn-third-basement floor

'I thought it was a typo caz there is only one basement
'But like I said I've had to do school-research all the damn time

'This building was only two floors for more than a decade later
'When the Uni was built over us

'I tried to correspond
'But nah nothing man

'We are talking total-silence as in
'Newspapers from that entire month
'All gone missing

'Sheit that archive I was on was national

They were panting hard having crossed three-floors

Ben countered at the steamroll-logic
'I been here all 3 years of school

'If there were multi-basement-levels
'There would be some proof

'A reworked stairwell
'Modified to only move up

'I been on both sides
'Of the main West-Well
'Those walls are as old as Miss Finely

'may-the-cunt-bitch-rest-in-peace

'There would be structural-pillars
'With three basements those pillars
'Cant just be erased off the structure

'I mean fk
'All of our classroom-ceilings
'Look all mangled-patchwork
'From the Uni construction

Ben's logic was solid
But life seldom follows logic

'You both believe that a stairwell could just disappear
'These stairwells were created by god on the 8th-day for fks-sake
_

The exterior wall was at the far-end
In the corner that held a closet door

Todd's sweaty palms slid on the locked knob
A narrow closet was exposed by the small window

'I-got-it
Jordan knelt in front
Took off his pack
Retrieved a pouch

The door was open and pack back on Jordan's back
Before the other two could follow the action

Once inside the back after the brooms & mops
A corridor was revealed to turn down a very-long-hallway

The narrow corridor
Followed the exterior wall

Single-file in the errie-way of knowing
An action would change life forever

Endorphins flowed in bounty of an oft asked question
Ben admitted

'I always thought it was odd
'There were no small windows
'In any of the rooms in the basement

'So this is the real outer wall

'The Fire Marshall
'Got the school on fire-code

'Rather than expose this wall
'They rather built that new northside-stairwell
'Whole week the Firemen escort'd people up to the hospital

The walls made of the pilgrim-old-brick
Large & thick & dark-purple
_

The tunnel was bare
It held no purpose
No back doors to any classrooms

It only continued
Long-passage-after-long-passage

The end came up abruptly
As a blank wall

Ben chirp'd
'The architect must have been a comedian

Jordan countered
'Or a way to hide access
'To an entire level in a closet

'Back in the day
'The bay was too huge

'Before all them well-to-do-fk-you
'Bought up all bayside lands
'Like being ocean-side is only a priviledge

'Damn back in the day
'This was a scary place to live
'Everyone with guns & knives

'Pirates raided every year
'Roy Miller's Path
'Arcs right where the school is
'This is as far as they ever went
'Often to kidnapped kids

'That's why we have that motto

'Once a Buc
'Always a Fk

Ben thought he knew alot about the school
But he only vaguely heard people talk of what Jordan said

Ben noticed on the old bricks
Symbols carved in peculiar diagrams
The sprawl of it was typical of angry graffiti

Todd had been busy searching for the door he now only-remembered

Todd's nails scraped against the wall
Along a fine-line found only after difficulty

Jordan moved him out of the way
& Went to work with a thin steel bar

Peeled-paint revealed a metal door
2ft above-the-ground 3ft high-and-wide

Jordan turned to them for-real
'Sheiit

'We get caught back here
'Gonna be us screaming
'Think some rag-hoe
'Gonna do the same for us

'Shit
'Best-recognize

'Might as well go all-in
'Right from the start

Jordan patted his bar on palm confidently

Todd took the bar from Jordan
'Maybe I should hold onto that

Jordan only looked onto his hand
He felt completely betrayed by it
So swift & sure the action

Jordan raised an eyebrow
Only content to let Todd do the rest of the work

They all helped pry the hinges into creaked-submission

Somehow Todd always knew this went down
Now he saw into the black depths

The door had the lock from the inside
The lock fell down the shaft in distant bangs for a long long time

'Pilgrims were paranoid muthrfkrs

Ben looked at Jordan
'Wouldn't you be

Jordan smirked back

? Be

'Hell Im worse
'My locks dont bend
_

Dark musty air flowed immediately to them
Strong-as-a-gulf-breeze
Hot as furnace vent

Something caught Todd's eye
He poked at it with the bar

Elevator-cords hung in the mid
Hidden by darkness

'If there are 3 lower basements
'Then there are two floors to explore

An exchange of glances agreed compliance

Jordan looked casual
Ben looked like he would not back down

Todd reached with extended-arm and grasped the cord
In a hard pull he let himself be drawn into the darkness

He left them with a confident smirk
He was prepared for this

Todd's hands began to slide
It was only a lurch
His heart ever-thankful

He lowered his hand to slip
In an unstoppable rapid-slide

!!! HAILMARYFULLOFGRACE
_

All was dark
Distance only an abstract measurement

Movement only testified by the-burning-of-his-palms
Sweat-sprung as will-fought-for-life

Todd ventured his legs out
He managed to stop himself into near splits

!!! TODD

The other two screamed frantically down

Todd looked up
The door only a small smudge of silver
In the infinity of dark space


'Im okay
'Im okay

'There is oil on the cords
'I should have expected it

'Gonna take off my shirt
'Use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

Ben asked automatically
Without idea on how to back up the offer
'Do you need help up

Todd fearless began to climb at a controlled rate
'Its best only one person
'Be on the cord at the same time

'Im gonna try
'To find a door
'To get to one of the floors
'I fell pretty far
'So Im guess'n up

Skin-peel-palms grateful-past-pain
For the cool protection of the shirt
_

Todd didn't notice any doors
In the commotion down

The best course would be to climb up slowly
To ensure he could get back up

He would feel for an open'n with this feet

The slide down had cleared off most of the oil
His covered-hands now had clean purchase

The only sound was his breath
And the swell of air

The gusts came intense
Rising with the heat-from-deep-darkness

Todd felt a gust on his stomach
It was cool & didn't come from below
He stomped out the outline of the door

! TWANG
! TWANG

A beam bore into the darkness

'I think

! I found it

With one hand he felt for a handle
The door was there, he could feel the cold metal

!! POMP
!! POMP

Todd stomped the corner down
He pulled himself higher
Kicking-down until the door gave way

He pulled himself into the dusty grey hallway

'I'm off the cords
'Come down

'Wrap your shirt around your hands
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Jordan challenged
'Best just stay back
'Something get loose and fall
'Right into your face

Ben & Jordan followed down and swiftly entered

Ben, last, climbed inside scraping his knee
Looking up saw Todd and shrieked back falling-on-his-ass

! FUCK

Todd was covered in dusk-caked dark-blood-mud
Blood not oil had been on the cords

Smears were left where Todd had touched himself
Jordan hadn't taken much notice of it

The sub-basement had no light
But the sliver of the dust
Seemed to repeat
What available light there was
_

This level was an abandoned hospital
All lay as if it had been unexpectedly sealed off

Dust caked everywhere
Jordan could easily see their tracks back

They went forward in a cautious manner of adventure

Electricity still flowed on this floor
Emergency-signs gave enough light for them to move secure

Ben told them
'That shaft went way past the length of the building

'This must be where they deposit all the bodies from the hospital
'But that explanation doesn't make much sense

Jordan continued
'It doesn't make much sense
'To have a hospital as a secret basement

'I expected a mid-evil sex-dungeon
'where-bad-kids-go-krumpus

At the end of the first hall
Jordan looked into a room

On the bed was a familiar form

'Hold up

Jordan walked inside the room
Only a bed pan & a flipped-over bed
With a swift fling he threw off the blanket

A long decayed corpse lay there turnt-off the-fallen-bed
The sweet smell stung their noses

The horror was simple
No screams or fear of life

Only a complete confidence
Their life was in danger
_

A loud-clang, shuffle and meaty-wacks where heard
A hoarse voice rose but was immediately silenced

The boys took shelter in the room
A corpse for company

The day had long-since
Numbed their nostrils

Jordan whispered
'Doesn't make sense
'Water from the tap
'Electricity

Ben
! Snap

He took off his pack
Using the blanket as tent

Plugged into power
Plugged into a raw-network

Jordan & Todd
Both the third-wheel

Rather look at the corpse
Neither help touch it to make a tent

Its hair over-grown
Its jaw dangled stoopidly

Its hollow eyes
Held a truth
Mystery to present company

Someone was trapped & beaten
In the concealed sub-basement of the school

The authorities would no-doubt
Do likewise to the trio of boys

In an abandoned level
Layers from escape

With only one known exit
An elevator shaft

Mousecraft
The sure way to go about these things

Patience & long-wait'n
Until absolute vacancy was established

Jordan an expert in this situation

For the entire period they waited
Bells could still be faintly-heard

The silence was a time of meditation

Accept the drastic turn of this Friday morn

Be ready to decide
Upon actions with dire-consequences
_

Their eyes & senses now accustomed they proceeded

Halls built in the same hight-cieling-structure of their school
One large hall circled the outside rooms & inner rooms

All told obvious signs
This area-of-the-basement was not used

Jordan guided their search
He tracked the dust
To know how long since last-passage

The inside of rooms
The highest-end in the vacancy-spectrum:

Untouched -> long-since -> this-month -> this-week -> today
_

Jordan now on a path
That was taken daily

One head-of-the-path
Led to a stairwell

They followed the other head
Towards a large-open-room inner-room

It dropped low
Into a deep arena

Workstations arrayed the entire space

Industrial-lamps draped
Over each stone table

Shiny-rungs glinted
Embedded as obvious restraint ports

Under each table
Various shelves
For various instruments

Jordan's heart fainted

All the tools
In all the stations
Down all the rows
Had-been-used-recently

This month for a massive operation

The only daily path led
To a table at center-stage
The only table with its light on

Strapped to the table by a broad-leather-belt
Was a nude-red-headed-girl

So bruised was her face
Impossible to see her freckles

Freckles covered her entire body
Freckled to the point that

Tho bloody, bruised & nude
All only the second characteristic noticed

First the infinite amount of cherry-colored-dots

She had stich-patch-openings all over her torso
Patches appeared in similar fashion all over her body

Her shut-eyes sprang into maniacal-alertness

Two large yellow-orbs

Three boys, not monsters, stood over her

Jordan was unable to free any strap
'How do we get these loose

Confused past-exasperated

'How
!daFKget
'These god-damn-straps-off

Yelling stupidly at the world
But really aimed at the girl

Entirely realizing
How idiotically loud he was

She screamed just recently
Now she won't speak to save her tail

Jewels looked back at him

She opened displaying
A mutilated-stump-of-a-tongue-in-a-wag

The stump was fresh
It had an odd-seal as if it was seared

A small muffled voice came to fullness
'Finally sorry
'I could not speak
'Hardly-breathe
'When she lays like that

'Don't you move like that neanderthal
'I need to get ready to introduce us
'A hundred years will teach you patience bitch

Infantile hands pushed its way out of a tangle of hair
A creature emerged from her shoulder

A shrunken-head
Two baby-arms attached
Under the shriveled-ears
_

The trio looked aghast

The girl
Had a monster perched on her shoulder

'Yes this is a shock
'I understand ignorance
The little head said in a small voice

Jewels cast her face-to-the-side-ashamed

Nude & openly disfigured
Took over her predicament as most-painful

The little head made a-small-exasperated-sound
'How are you such a bitch all the time
'I can find you a new-tongue
'A longer one if you are into-that
'You had much worse now no need to disrespect me
'Miss the Countess for-fucks-sake

Jordan leant in between the two
! we-gotta-get-the-fk-outta-here

'The bands are one leather belt
'Hurry up
'There is not a second to spare
The head said quietly

'Above our head you can release it
'Come on you rats

'Jewels can't speak now
'& I can't read her mind
'But I can sense what she is feeling

'She feels ashamed of me right now
The puppeted-head trailed on

Jordan found the clasp to be odd-shaped
Only after some ingenuity was it released

Only with the help
Of the metal bar and 6 arms

Jordan's shirt was the least dirty
Jewels wore it as a small dress

Miss had them make a measurement & a cut
To tailor the shirt to mold to her-form

The demeanor of Miss
Had an instant way
To blind the truth
& Interact like to-an-adult

Ben's shoes didn't fit Jewels
Only his socks

Miss rapped Ben as he knelt to take of his shoes
The rod extended to a painful twang that resonated in his skull

'We need to hurry
'If they come back soon
'Each one of us will be strapped
'All the worse for let

Promptly they made exodus
Out that devilish auditorium

The light had a cruel elderly-tint-of-aged-desperation
The rays seemed to follow them in a-haunting-fashion as-if-pointing-direction
Vengeful that what they had accepted must be fated-true unto-all
_

The elevator-cord now clean enough to allow them quick-access back up to the basement

Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their predicament

Todd was smeared over in blood
Thin-streams ran down his face like bloody-tears

Jordan was shirtless
His odd-shaped-belly budged-out

All were caked in dust

& Then there was Jewels

Ben admitted despair
'How the fk are we going to get out of school
'They are going to know where we have been immediately

'Put us back down here at all costs

Jordan wailed back
'Fk they will just say
'It was another goddamndrill

'That shit happens like every couple months

'I have a plan
Todd opened the closet door
And walked into the school hall

Dusty
Shirtless
Pantless
Bloody

They broke into the hall
Cast from horror

Sharply outlined
To a monotony-of-normal-scenes

The view more contrast
By their outlandish forms

Todd had a pre-planned route of exit

At the end of the hall
A teacher stopped her lecture
She opened the door and yelled

!!! MONITOR
!!! MONITOR SECTION 7

!!! 559

The call for all
To plaster against hall-windows
In a mosh-pit of greedy-kids

Starving for 1st-hand-account
Of only limited-viewing

Day-dreamt in revels
Of the earlier shit-show

Several girls touted
The hideous state
Of the toilet of the explosion
Some kid Ben had made
Who afterwards never found
As if he exploded instead of his ass

Up on lunch-meal-meds
Now in a riot
Each young-heart feral

The four spectated
Only by the larger-classmates

Todd led them around the corner
To rush up the stairwell

The teachers in this way
Were barred from looking out

Two large Monitors stood as sentinels
In locked-down-protocol at the-main-exit

!!! MONITORS
!!! SECTION 1

Two voices boomed

But Todd already turnt
Leading them up stairwells across the level

There was no time to explain
Only for Todd to choose and the rest to follow
_

Cross the school in this method
All Monitors would be drawn to the wrong location

Their exit was higher-up school-levels
Not at the ground-floor as expected
_

Every window filled
Every door blocked

Curious-children stirred by shouts
Starved-sight of the spectation
Charged by an eventful-day

Teachers more scared
Of the fight-pits
Than their duty

This factor allowed the five
To the second-floor unhindered

Several kids were later
Taken up & hospitalized

That riot burned
In hearts of the youth
_

Jordan pulled out his bar
'This-deep-in-it
'Now is the reckoning

'Suggest you wake-up likewise

Ben took the hint
He had a second-purpose for his laptop-computer & cords

They passed the restroom of the morn
Towards the end of the hall

Todd took out a key from his pocket
He unlocked the window

'Just do what I do
'Go where I go

They climbed out onto a narrow ledge
The sun shone hotly on them
They burned under it with exhaustion

The world around them too-busy-with-the-day to notice
Four-odd-bodies outside on the second-story

The ledge continued to an adjacent roof
They crossed over to a high-branched tree

The branch overhung onto the roof in an entangled attachment

By that means they climbed down ground-level
At the back of the school

Onward into alleys
Towards less-traveled roads

Each of the boys knew how to pass-this-area without-being-seen
They ran tired but now they knew this-stage was their-turf

They knew over what fences led where
Up which buildings to what

Rat-true
Now they could not get caught

Jewels
Only had a large shirt & Ben's sweaty socks

Headed now by Jordan
The other too at her side

This kept her mostly covered

Large-city-bustlers continued their way without heed
The four moved as a pack following Jordan's lead
_

They arrived at the edge of Downtown
Outskirts to the industrial-sector

Jordan turned them into an alley
& Thru a chain-linked-fence hole
He loosed then bound-back

Thru a locked-window they quickly entered
The edifice as dusty as the sub-basement

They cautiously followed Jordan's movements

Hopping from board-to-board
Their trace with few tracks

Up the stairs to a room

Jordan locked the room with a chain after they entered
He then pushed away a cabinet to reveal another chain-locked door

'This far from anyone
'Gotta be triple-sure
'So as to sleep

'Break'n thru one of these
'Loud enough to wake whatever sleep

An outside window exposed the endless ocean
Dust free & ocean breeze

Jordan led them thru the window
To a ledge that was covered by patched-tarps

The floor was of netted-metal
A repurposed fire-escape

'Got a tank of rain water
Jordan motioned with his hands

'Open the spout
'& Close it with this knob

Jordan motioned them to turn around

'It aint clear-water
'But cleaner than you

He took a brisk wash in water heated-by-the-sun
The water splashed far below

While waiting for Todd to finish
Ben asked Jordan
'So what is this place

He laid on the tatami

Jordan looked-down as his face blushed
'This is one of the places I go to live
_

Refreshed & completely exhausted

All laid on layers of
Cardboard-stitched japanese-tatami

Ocean gusts massaged their tense skin
All slept out-till-next-morn

In safe slumbers
Soothed by the-sound-of-steady-waves
_

They all woke in the daze
Of a new life

Jordan fed them dried fruit & granola
Desert was a Mtn-Dew

'Got locations like this
'City wide

'I can go any where
'And find myself alright in an hour

'Tho this one is the nicest
'Each has a stash of all I need

'Last week I was stuck across town
'I ate bad food I stashed I guess

Jordan finished looking apologetically at Ben
All that now mostly forgotten by the day

!fk

Ben realized his predicament with this father

His father would be ready with a self-righteous beating

It was Saturday-morn

From Friday-morn to now
The trance finally woken

Jordan had a rummage-of-clothes at that place
Raided from the downtown charity

Jewels was head-to-toe with garments that mostly fit
She had hiking-sandals with wool stockings
The light-blue summer-dress only-a-little-too-short

That morn her
& Miss the monster
Tailored the outfit
With repurposed-stockings for her forearms

Miss always held a finely-made extendable-umbrella
This would bar anyone from seeing what was quick-to-hide

Jordan now wore a pocketed vest

Ben took an old-leather-jacket he tied in a roll under his pack

Todd took a set of wool gloves for his hands

The shrunken head had stayed silent since their escape

It held the umbrella
'unoffended
_

Jordan trailed their exit
Covering their tracks as they returned to the streets

'Take everything
'I never go to the same place
'In the same week

Ben needed to get to the payphone at the lower-district Circle-K

The day was warming to be hot

The heat relaxed overworked-muscles
After a prolonged-stiff-sleep

Ben looked at Todd
'We only have enough for one call
'You mind if I use it

Todd complied
'I am the last of our litter
'My parents wouldn't know if I was gone for a week

The pressing pace of life left Jewels
Still to be sorted out
_

After 4 rings
Ben tried the oldman next-door

This wasn't the first time
This exact thing had happened

The old voice responded
'Heeh Hello

'Mr. Grinvix this is Ben
There was no response for some time

'I just wanted to call to ask about my dad
'He isn't answer'n the phone
'If you see him can you tell him I got a way home

Ben waited awkwardly
Only the sound of heavy breath'n

'Your dad
'is dead boy

'You best get to the authorities
'an have 'em tell ya

The voice was sympathetic but immediately hung up

Ben stood silent leaving the phone to his ear
Flabbergasted from truth-revealed-lie

? His dad would always be there

A jackass who tried hard to keep light of heart

To never-again hit him
Nor give him advice-no-other-could

Regretful of being a father
Who was stuck with a son

Man enough to power thru that hardship
That too-often-than-not himself the cause

Ben physically-worked to come-to-grips

Understandings toppled down
Dazed among rubble

The four in silence
Left him space to wail
_

!!! PLUUPP
!!! PLUPPP

A police car had silently snuck up behind the crew
Its lights now bright at their backs

'Alright you juuhhhh

The cop cut short as the pack immediately bolted

He turned & fumbled open the door
Which he preemptively shut

Today was not a mood
'Im gonna bust diaphrams
'fkn-lil-shit-fks

The officer called into his shoulder-piece
'Broc here
'I got a 281 on that 48f
'Update the 48f is now a 49f

He reversed with sirens blaring
Confident he didn't need to look back

His focus-as-predator never dropping target

In that action he was fused
Into the building Circle-K

An overworked-trucker plowed
Backed by near a ton of Coca-Colas on trailer

An unstoppable mountain
Until about 15-feet in

Flesh crunched in sharp folds of metal
Soaking Dorito-chips like salsa
& Drowning the cop
In a cold-death of
Mountain-Dew Slurpee
_

Todd looked back in relief

That cop coming
Must have been the result
Of Ben calling his neighbor

The timing on the cop
Made sense if dispatched from Downtown-Station

What was this all about?
Did it have to do with Ben?
Or is this a result of yesterday?

The question caught his throat
Grateful many more steps
Still to take before an answer

Todd led the exhausted group 
Up the hills towards his home 

Ben had not said a word
The group kept silence naturally

If the death of Ben's dad
Was related to yesterday

It would soon be known 
 
Would his life likewise be shattered

That horizon
Closer with each step 
& Familiar-landmark

A synchronized group
Says less & does more

Silence lightens the load with comtemplation
Silent-interactions the substance of their communication 

The deep sleep of last night
Swept away traceless 

Now only the entreched feeling
Of a labor with no timely solution

Now only the acceptance of pain
As a-state-of-being

The five-miles drew two-hours time
Under sun in cloudless sky
_

Seagulls squaked 
Enjoy'n the uncomfortable position
Of beings the gulls envied

Tables now turned to the birds favor
What is toilsome for humans is a lesiure birds

The world continued careless
Inside cars disconnected from their momentary-coordinates
Distracted by the thought of the destination 

Four souls suffering & unable
To begin to voice the matters-at-hand

Their souls at full-capacity with the present journey
_

The made their way up 
The hills that loomed 
Over the Downtown bay

Skipping across to the 
Sidewalks with most shade

A world at normality
Betrayed as an alien-state

To a group so fused
In the throes of turmoil

Miss broke the silence 
'My name is Miss
'We have not formly met

Others didn't respond

'I already know your names
'No need to introduce again
'Tho it would be polite

The communication took time to digest
After the miles & silence of misery
They just continued dumbly

Miss paitently continued
'I have been attached by operation  
'To this girl Jewels who was offered
'As sacrifice to the diety Dagon

'To introduce Dagon to the unanointed
'Is an oath-breaking death-sentence

'But I have the favor of the Seer
'So I may do as I please keeping-oathsworn

'Dagon is a cosmic god
'Infathomable & Unsaitable

'Earth is bribed to Dagon 
'As an occult offer'n by those of the

'Esoteric Order of Dagon

'A sacrifice of this world
'& All worlds connected by Quantum-Entanglement
'For the bounty
'Past imaginations which gods bestow


'All Earth will be consumed
'Drained dry as Mars

'Great powers lie in the foundations of this cult
'The blessings of omnipotent-powers-uncalculable 

'Some envision the gift of infinite-life
'Indesuptably to be as god themself

'I am one of those in faith of Dagon
'All worth in exchange for a god's blessing

'Jewels is the daughter of a wealthy family

'To pay the price of a family to join 
'The prime of their seed must be exchanged

'I am 400 years old
'The symbiotic member of this girl

'As payment into the order 
'The past must live as youth

'Don't be fooled 
'I offer much

'I heal her & repair her
'Myself surgeon centries-in-experience

'I guarntee her life till old age as a promise

The mass of Miss moved 
Her an inner-fleshly-lump in a manmade-skull the size of a small-ball 
The ball free to move to diffferent parts of Jewels body 

The right shoulder is her perch 
She talks there with the baby-arms holding the umbrella

'We worship the bowels of Dagon

'In Jewels was inserted divine-microbials
'This the digestion of the gods

'When I was an old woman we found the asteroid

'Tales of Eastern-Monks who under-tourture
'Guided us to prophetized mountain-village

'Prophecy built on ancient astrology 
'& Deep-cosmic-mathematics could not be leinient 

'Decades after mining to the asteroid
'Lead to unprecedented discoveries

'The asteroid contained mavervelous gifts 

'The Mound-of-Excrement of Dagon 
'Holy-be-it-Enternally

'Sadly only this small mass of me was left
'When the bateria-microbials were adjusted to our needs 

'These microbrial bacteria 
'Enhance the host completly 

'Bacteria that worship
'The well-being of the host as life-itself

'Jewels is stronger than all you boys combined

'Microbials refine all ingestion 

'I myself was the first generation to live with prepared hosts
'Viceroy Countess Miss of the Prime Circle - priestess of the mass 

'If that name doesn't get you out of a pinch
'At future point when your life on the line
'Then Imma whores-wet-nurse

They kept to the sidewalks
With the most shade & least people
The day was hella-hot & the boys burned pink

'I would proclaim 
'Jewels owes us much 

'But she is a foolish girl
'Gets youthful emotions 

'Yes Jewels is foolish
'Myself always busy 
'Patch'n up what she self-inflicts

! WACK

Jewels lightly back-handed Miss

! PFT

Miss mumbled sorrowfully quiet for a time

'Well-I-never-in-my-life

But after a few blocks
Miss regained her full-compsure

'Tho 
'I am sympathtic 

'To her need to be kept
'From our modular fashions

'The inner-courts ordered her to be pieced
'Into a more streamlined-being

'The operation was for this morn 

'Jewels is held by us as a priestess
'Name annointed Jewels by the Seer 
'Who fated her to rise above the most high

'The freckles on her body
'Are bits to a map to constellations

'The coordinates to a universe
'That attracts the best quantum-possibilites in all situations

'The Order will seek her out because she is this map 
'This skin even-as-leather will leads us to that universe 

'Only by the boon of Dagon
'After this world is consumed 
'Is it possible to fulfill the godsent-command
'To arrive in a Space-Of-Best-Blessings

'The freckles ever-changing
'Ehoe'n to quantum existence 

'Understand this 
'Her future has such consequence

'If her skin was lost to the Order
'It would mean the end of this most-unique possibility

'Only one of our Entangeled-Possibilities needs to reach this destination
'Fate the power which will drag all divergencies into that perfect trajectory

'The sacrifice of all
'As payment for all to attain
'A more perfect existence

'Our order alone
'Decide'n for all 
'In solemn manners

Miss stayed herself a while 
Jewels needed to regain strength

It was not easy for Miss to talk
While Jewels walked 

'The Esoteric Order of Dagon 
'Dates to mankinds earliest history 

'Trends have taken its symbolism to idolitary 
'Fools will be fools

'The Image of Dagon
'Alone necessary 
'To wield unobstructed power 

'Molecules bow to will
'Exerted in presence of that Image

'I myself am a prophetess ordained by the Seer
'The Seer secretly entitled me
'Follow paths by accordance to Jewels

'But the force of the whole-cult 
'Too much to stop
'Someone this imporant must be improved as insurance

'The thunder of your friend woke us 
'Providence gathered all that morn 
'To rescue us out of an unbreachable-system 

'Knights & heroes pale to the deeds 
'Which you have yesterday all fulfilled

'It only at the cost
'Of only half a tongue

Miss proclaimed as if that a blessing
Miss was odd company to have 

The only thing pleasant
On the long stretch to Todd's house

The sun hot in the hour before noon

Lights were on in his house

The smell of the outside
Inside the house 

The windows were broken
Leaves whipped-up under family-portraits

Forms of countless-cats
At once were made out
Infesting every shadow

Suddenly the felines
Sprang into a frenzy

A large Calaco immediately charged Todd 
The heft of it large 
Its muscles buldging-tense

Todd had two-smarts-on it
Simple a kick & a snatch

Each of his siblings
Had owed a cat
He could own these assholes

10 cats stopped the attack
None of them 

Cared to risk 
The same demise of their leader

Which was duplicated
Repeat & repeat

Calaco a goolike-mash-upon-the-walls

The pulp of it arose 
Any kitty salivate so exquistely-rare the cuisine

Dispite quelled up with a great fear of the present
Several stopped for a quick-lick

Cats swarmed over something on his parent's bed

Most of the body was chewed up
But it was his mother

Todd began vomiting 
Into the habitual direction of the restroom

Huched-face-first-ass-out across the toilet
Past-prime-pickings into a gluttonous-feed

Todd cleared out his home
Macabre painted by stern-rigtheousness 

The corpses of his parents foamed out of each mutilated orafice
Grey puss foamed as lines of each scratch

Todds thick wool-gloves
No cat-claw could pierce
_

Neighbors came out to witness 
Only for a loathesome moment

Guilty & in fear
Of the boy they all betrayed

None able to venture near
With two basketball-players dead

On the way home
Deciding to aid

To crumble up
In agonizing death
Quick to come
_

Past tears 
After the last of the cats
Caught in Todd's grasp

Bathed in warm guts 

Todd would use his might
To break bust the belly

Legs-to-legs
Above his head 

Cats in a lunacy
To avoid the same fate

Busy in actions 
That sealed their fate

The thick wool golves 
Made for pussy-busting

Gloves as relic
Of providence-sent

Raw flesh able to breathe
Yet protected from all-else
_

Cats take too long
To do anything 

In calculated actions
Aun to their demise

Cats have 9 lives
But they are their
Own-worst-enemy

10s of bodies
Litered the rooms 

Jules could not walk fast with the sandals
Jordan & Ben decided to give Todd his space

Near 100 disembowled-bodies trailed Todd's direction

Over short distance the cat is quick
Over long distance mankind reigns supreme

Aun to naps the cats will be put-off-guard 
Only awoken too late
By the scent of gore dripping off Todd 

Over-fence, thru-yard
Along-country-road, over-cemeteries, thru-fields

Until finally rocky bays of ocean 

Rock-to-rock in hops 
Crashing waves below

Cats moved with agility 
But Todd still much faster

The cats boulder to boulder 
Death lay for mistake 
& For success

Only one entry 
Into a thicket-walled-island

Todd climbed up 
Birthed in gore 
_

The twist'n narrow-tunnel
Opened up into a vast expanse 

Antiquated farm-equipment
Animals of a rare variety

Fire-pits with altars 
Countless covered the open grounds

One solitary hut 
Built large as a warehouse 
Loomed in the center

Tatched roof to sustain hurricane winds
The edifice had a lifted concrete-foundation

A large bonfire-pit in the center of the circular lot 
_

The cat with the first warning-message 
Only-just-returned
 
As if Todd introduced to as Reaper 
He entered into the scene
A mess of steaming-mass
Vengence unsaitable

Slow is man
To be slain barehanded
_

The three finally caught up to dunes
The cats would not near the area

All sat outside
In a countless ring

Too-tired from their massive trip
Too-frightened to  move 

The group had to step over all the cats
Starling them with kicks
Off wildly-interesting dreams

Todd was off to himself 
All content to a corner 
_

Jewels stomached her way around the witch's hut
Parts of the witch were so-scattered-such
She prayed it due-to-hungry cats 

Leatherbound Tomes 
Laid upon altars under balcony 

Each with a bonfire-pit
Great iron-pikes stood
To hook upon a cauldron

Jewels spent her time in the study of these tomes
Or prolonged-deduction of the state of each pit

Symbols, parts & bowels
Mixtures & brews
_

The city on lookout for them
No where to go but where they were

The supply of the witch enough to last years
Water piped from a resivoir the size of a pond 
It was kept lifted & clean

Firewood came pentiful off ocean drifts

Three weeks went by with even less words between them

Jordan & Jewels who kept to their own interests
They each slept alone each in-front of the plentiful fire-pits
_

Ordained with life's calling
Jewels absorbed herself
Learning the ways of the witch

Miss created a tome
Four-tomes two-wide

A large wooden shield-iron-bound
Each full of weather-resistant leather-pages

Leather-pages made from the thin flesh of the abundant dead cats
_

Jordan spent his time in exploration 

He admired the excellent situation of the island
This base would prove his most beloved 

Built from foundation to be off-the-grid
Preserving better utilities than county

A worn rock cliff dropped off to mellow-deep-ocean-waters 
One leap would exfoliate ones skin in deep-cleanse

Sea life was plentiful & transient
_

Ben & Todd in similar circumstance
Understood each other as entirely divergent with their reactions

There was a global power that aimed to get them at whatever cost

To have Ben's dad murdered in an unknown way
To send cat-assassins of wiccan conjury
To eliminate an entire household 

The price they had paid
For their decisions were heavy
_

The song of every bay 

Existence is only ever in seasons

Day after day
Today is only just another day

Todd & Ben both well-healed in time
In the careful-ways of slow-healing
_

Ben powered his laptop to the solar-power-station

Todd kept day-long meditations

Jordan lived in peace as if finally repaid from turbid years 

Jewels shielded with a Tome she worshipped as shrine

Miss ever diligent to guide & grow her talents into abilities

Driscol now permenantly-closed
All students transferred to different schools

The five learned these facts back in town
A month had passed since it was closed

5 girls had gone missing after all the chaos

One the girls gossiped due to karma 
The girl had almost as big-of-shit as Ben
Earlier down the stalls
The janitors refused to clean it


The lunch-lady cried to the monitors
Two large men tooked a girl to the basement

There were no large men found in the basement
The lunch-lady held for questioning

The hospital also lost 25% of its patients
In an outbreak that left the city block full of wails

Police could only evacuate
Due to the pure-madness of the chaos

They spoke of monsters & fish-people
_

The lengthy-trip to the city
Took half a day

Jewels & the cats kept to each other fondly
Cats avoided Todd at eyesight

Reveering Todd with gifts only as he slept

Dead rats, fish, live-crabs
& Plenty of money & chains

Todd took to a massive religious-piece
All made in gold large-enough-to-hold
The heft of it a precious-relic
_

The store was a feast 

Feline robbers stashed funds daily

They stuffed their packs with supplies 

Sacks of food were tied to their packs
twinkies bread peanut-butter cheeses

The Downtown bus was free for their age
_

Baytowns pull in lost-loiters world-wide

Each soul on drift with the tide
Drawn to far-away spheres

The library sat on the hill 
The homeless hobos just below

The Library kept an overgrown field to the back 
The lot left alone as a wild thicket

No-homeless succeeded in making any part of it a home
To a fresh density even fire would fail to burn thru
There being hidden in the middle open-access to the city water
Which the plants feeded off with too much to spare

At the turn of a corner-side-tree
The five entered the shadows

Jordan lifted a make-shift-bush 

'I really feel sorry for you
'Trust me
'I do

'But keep the bitching down
'There are hobos all around

Crawling packs-first thru a maze 
The trail looked to be made by a rabbit

The walls were too narrow for an adult

Relentlessness if tried true 
Rewared a broken-body onto a open path

The path was neat as a tunnel
A netted-canopy-roof kept out light

The path walled by lamp-posts
_

All bled

'I put those thorns in myself
Jordan said to their bewilderment

??? What

'alright-fk-off
'I was much bloodier
'Each day than you are now
'& That took me 
'All winter & five jackets
'But look what we got to ourselves
'A fkn-fortress 
!daymn
'Love being forced to make that path

No one was in the mood to buy-into-that-reasoning
_

Dim-lights lit the completely-enclosed concrete-path 

Miss admired-always for her cheery-perspectives

'Heavy & resilient cords were attached by several posts
'All for that darned Carnival-DesMondes

'If there weren't such 
'Death to the tale I'd call it a-hoot-to-boot

'The arrogant-migrant-workers disrespected the tropical-storm
'Only-just-set-up-just-drunk that first night 

'The storm built into a Hurricane 

'From different-lands is different-fish 
'As we say

'The hurricane rearraged this area but these cords held strong 
'They are the foundation for this thick canopy
_

The path led to a utility shed 
Power & water & network

'Fort Thickets
An intricatly-carved-log claimed the lot

Miss continued
'This place forgotten the years that followed Huricane Karma
'I remember having walked by it now
'How the years hide their gems

'Two-years after Karma
'Only Univeristy Hospital kept open 

'That is why University Hospital has unparalleled off-the-grid-independence
'Able to host of the entire-regions-network

Ben jolted
'The entire region 
'Networked to the same place

That is why all his route-tracers returned bogus-information

Jordan explained
'My grandpa worked here 

'It used to be only grass out to the street

'On aresearch-project on our ancestors
'There were several fotos of my grampa
'Different parts of this place 
'Several for all the Fairs

'I didnt recognize the place near the Library

Jordan pointed to a framed paper on the wall
'Ganked that piece at the Library

The old schematic was the original library building plan
_

All took comfort in the utilities
There was a makeshift shower built for privacy

A hose & a drain
But welcome after their hard-days

All together center room
Still missing the comfort of fire

Jordan made the supplies be rationed
The others complied understanding
So hard was the journey

Jordan last to sit

'One night past-midnight
'I was stuck on this side of town
'Crackhead-muthrfkrs to cross to get to Industrial

'Rain in a storm & air in coldfront

'The security guard saw me 
'Loiter'n and maybe crying 
'He called me inside

'I could stay until his shift ended at 6
'I ate half of his lunch & dried-up

'I was so cold I drank the entire pot of coffee

'Man I wanted to bathe in the sin so bad
'Hell-na more I needed a bath

'But that would have freaked-out the guy

Jordan looked to the others
In confirmation that the action was indeed weird

'Coffee kept me in good-spirit 
'Which I used to pure force 
'After I snuck out with that building-plan

'First time I ever had coffee
'Couldn't stop the pursuit until I arrived

'The state of it today 
'Much easier to get thru back-then

'I had to brute-force some parts
'Hell quarter-mile far crawling
'Lots of switch-backs 
'Parallel to the other

'I was expect'n to find the place
'Only four-posts left of it

'But as you can see it in good condition 
_

The four rested on bedding 
In the same japanese-tatami-fashion

Electricity filled their time 

Ben took a trip with Jules
To return with the computer

This place a much more stable enviornment for electronics
Jules resillence-for-pain helped carry Ben

It felt odd
Talking to a mute

Guilty
Like you were cheating
_

Tapped into the regions network
Direct link to networks with forging addresses
Ranging from the large amount that pass thru the Library as Bridge

Carefree lives begged obsession

Ben used his unix network skills
To secure them deals-around-town 
rides, chores, grocery

When they needed odd necessities 
Ben would find various people to do them

He would pay them remotely or with codes
The delievery would throw the stuff
In an opening in the vegitation
Jules-Ben created
Only accessible from below 

Ben had collected many names with reputation
These he manuevered to get what he needed

This deal consisted of transistors, pop-tars, Mtn-Dew
The guy offered to throw in an 1/8 of shrooms & marijuana

Ben who mistook did not understand him well
The well-tipped-delivery planted the stash gratefuly in the paper bag

They would then be mapped to a location there with stashed money
'Hundred in the coke-can buried under the trashcan
'Fifty taped in the crease of a bench

Jordan oathed them all to wait for an hour in the bush before entering
That was one of Jordans oathsworn protocols

Ben resistless-obeyed so great was his appreciation
A tap into the regional network with always-on power

Ben had been grabbing data from the archives at the library 
He stored them onto drives he implanted in each computer

With the cat's money he built a mainframe 
It constantly whirred with its different activities
The whir greeted him as he opened the shed door arms-full-of-supplies

Jordan immediately popped up surprised 
'Who ordered the weed

'Jewels will like those
Miss said overlooking Jewels rummage 

Jewels still irate that she didn't have a new tongue
Miss replied tartly
'Tongues don't just grow-for-the-pickings
'Where am I to get a suitable source & workstation

Cats everywhere except around Todd

Pimping new cats nightly
They would come in with an offer

Jules would feed them cakes
That skull-fkd-delight

Fed & taught the ways

The decimated-ranks 
Rapidly grew & grew
_

The boys kept down communication 
Miss left no way to communicate with Jewels independently

No ways to verify that Jules wasn't a prisoner

When Todd lurched out his hand forceing the ball-that-is-Miss To stay into the shrunken-head

The other two acted without preemption 
At first Jewels held-down-firm

Jordan went to grab the chain
They had to settle this

Todd struggled not to strangle Miss
While fight'n down Jewels the amassing-power of Jewels

The two could only give-way little-by-little
Any minor victory was responded with greater loss

'We
'we need to know

! CRUNCH 
Jewels head butt Tood's jaw closed

'ST STOP
Jewels let her elbow fly
accoustomed to more-monsterous holds

Jules broke free and ran inside 
Ben was praying his nose wasn't broken 

He bled out like a fountain

Todd eventually got the idea to pass thru a notebook

'Trust me when I say Miss is dear to me
'Her over anyone else is my true friend
_

Blood is thick with one's identity
The composition is stired by one's emotion

Blood magic draws stregth from those forces
They drank the brew of shroom
Blood-dreched-mint leaves

Worked together into a pactice of blood
To bind themselves together in rites

The five & many of the OG cats

Trance-State-Jewels formed an intricate DIAGRAM
Writter over the center of the floor

'May the blood split
'For concern of other
'Bind us five together

Four of them as corners
Arms the connection between
Legs to stablise & aid momentum
Eyes to see the truth in individual

The vapor off the aroma
Weed inhaled as incense

The hot brew in their stomachs digested slowly

The pot laid in the circle 
Chalked-around-with their diagrams

Hours-upons-hours
Passed morn and night morn

Students to a wakened-state
 
Their movements as all-surfing-on-the-same-wave
In-tune at different positions of the swell

All looked at the other in odd understand'n
As if whispers strengthened bonds with assurance

They kept their hands together bound
Jewels voicelessly passed them thru the struggles discomfort

Miss recited

'Comfort is a worthy sacifice

'We care for each other
'If this pain binds us tight

'We reap of true bounty

After the hours of fasting 
Cleansed-via-vomit

They took their always-packed-packs & left Downtown
They would crawl wearing winter-overalls

Instead of the left turn towards the Dunes
Jewels lead to her old school towards Uptown

Miss began her story
'The Duties are old-dike-identical-twins
'I am sure you have heard of them

'Boot-stomping-bruisers
'Bristly as an english-boar

'So loud was their march
'It was impossible to take them seriously
'Assigned to babysit at Ray High 

'As decades passed the women were finally put to the test
'An abductor, of no small size, attempted an idea that would end his life 

'The jarhead beaten to death in a half-hour-struggle
'To this day large-battle-scars

Ben interrupted
'Yeah I've seen that
'Faces of Death covers the last-leathal-10-min-of-the-brawl

'But word is the first twenty were ghastly
'What recorded only a tired-end

'The kidnapped girl crying up to the two women in gratitude
'Tho they looked mostly-dead

Miss hooted
'That girl was our Jewels when she was 5
'OhMyGod was it a fright
'I enjoyed the entire show from binoculars of the Penthouse
'Whiskey & Tennessy-man oh it was magical to end to a beautiful night

'Back to the story
'Kinda important so no more inturruptions

'These dikes coughing-up-blood posing for the media

'Everyone knew not to fuck with the Twins
'Hollywood's film still tops charts

'In that fame the women reigned-never-checked 
'But they never step out of line either

'Old age has its toll
'Beauty must sleep 

'3:30 - 3:45 Neither can keep their eyes open
'The lure of that sweet rest into blissful wakefulness

'If you see two woman coming at you
'Jewels begs you to drop the bikes & run
 
'We have ten minutes lets go

(what)

'We came here to steal bikes
'I didn't have time to explain
'But a warning is all you need

'Pick one fast & quiet or get face-stomped

They dove in the lot 
Snuck under the booth 
Where on-que slept the two

Every action was worrisome for them 
Jewels stitched face & unseeming passager

City authorities already on the alert to get them

This venture had to pull of smooth

Single-handedly cause their school to be shut down forever with riots & massacre 
Jordan said the deaths were caused by the trail of blood off Todd 

They could only hope Jewels was smart about this move

Stressed persperation bloomed from their palms

The lot of bikes were open for the take'n
Unchained by the confidence in the Duties who knew the owner of each bike

big small large brite pimp
A selection unparalleled by any shop

Several bikes on the front gold-colored rack grouped together
All other bikes allowed respectful space

Jules went immediately & lifted the foremost-bike on her off shoulder 
She held the pedal with her hand

Miss chripped
'We are ready hurry hurry rats

Her bike was the leader's
It was a tricked-to-shit bmx bike 

Todd took the practical road-bike
Looked sturdy after a decade of use

Ben hoisted up a rugged mountain-bike
The puffy tires had a relentless attitude

Jordan was sweating under his load

(are you fkn serious)

The four whispered in unison
The pimp-ed out bike was ostentacious

Here wasn't the place to debate
They swiftly headed out

Following Jewel's hand motions
Silent directions to keep the bikes from making noise

Unobstructed back out on the streets within 5 minutes

After the corner turn they shouted & hooted
High-speed down-hill on bikes fit for them

Too-high-speed
Cach began to speed-wobble away from the other
After close-calls the frames finally maintained

Blasting out onto the coastline
The fourbikes bullied lanes

Jordan on a lowriding bike 
All set in chrome
Lights-pimped-with-gadgets 

His kicked-back-position drew his left lip in a look of coolness
His pack bound on top of the front tire

By the time they came off the high from the trip they were bayside 
Front bonfire before night-sky at the Dunes

They could only piece back the earlier events
Greatful of the plunder 
Busy taking notes on the insights give to them on the trip

Todd kept all their dealings in a record which he kept without fail 
They would tell their stories in a bonfire of which Todd recorded
_

Jewels never kept from work 
Produced the brew she made Miss memorize

Able to act free alone on island
All attention to the moment

Each have'n lost & gained 
Worth longlasting contemplation 

Lonely states allow the soul
To be susceptible to higher states of being

Reenforced need thru the rubble
Of demolished states of being

They all stared at Todd's replication of the DIAGRAM Jewels had drawn
She replicated it on a virgin part of the dunes at South-Moon

The DIAGRAM was singular in fashion & make
Magnetic bonds pulled them tangibly to sit in their placements

Miss began
'This was contact of other beings
'Attracted to us via quantum-entanglement

'All are connected by quantum-bonds to kindred spirits

'The bond is a constant proof of the infinity 
'Distance is of null impact

'The bonds drawn in sleep
'Experience lives of others as Passangers

'Dagon
'We are taught is the god of universe

'His echo from AEons       
'His might truth

'Nations seek to call him forth as a gateway to divine gifts
'Tho all their world stripped upon his arrival

'The distance that seperates the cosmos is unfathomable

'Quantum properties testify 
'All realities that can pass will pass

'When one acts it creates possibility
'The more divergent the possibility the stronger

'One creates universes
'& reworks destiny in actions

'Possibility-Severance occurs when two-liknesses diverge to irrevocable-paths
'Cases have been made for two sects: Chaos & Order

'The distance tween cosmos is unbreachable 
'Aun for the Holy Dagon

'Each life has the power infinitely stronger to breah the barrier of distance
'To contact the other thru human spirit consortium that makes up our bonds

'All hearts to power the other in a robust network
'That act together but physically alone

'This power when grouped by massive actions
'Can open the portal to allow Dagon God thru

'Pulling him to their location to feast

'Thru ancient traditions passed down by the ages
'Evidence found writ on ancient-asteroids

'We reknewn tonight
'The Artes of Occult Cosmos Projection

'A rite learned & perfected to directly communicate across realities
'Experience to be shared across realities

'This DIAGRAM given to us is the public gate 
'Our private understanding & connection with the symbols 
'That is the key to authenticate the intention 

'If we are lured by dangerous hands
'Symbols will betray the trap 

'You will find each
'Is their own-worst-enemy

'Each in an Order of Ourself for Chaos or Order 
'To focus them inward as a check of four proofs in Order
'To roam in chaos affecting many equations

'The Five of us strong together
'Each at corner for other

'Our rite will be our position we assumed

'We will bind our hands & sleep 

'By purchase of comfort
'We attain a way to project to other realities

'Able to learn on a scale of infinity 
'Which will all confirm singularity in a situation

Position tho uncomfortable laid-natural
As if only a nudge dropped them down full-swing

All woke each in a different quantum reality in Lucid Dreams

All the world
Was inside a dome of earth 

Illuminesent-roots 
Dangled dripping light from the roof 

? A massive volcano covered all
? With no breach in the barrier

The plants glowed 
In shining marvels

Each plant different 
Each uniquely-florescent in mathematical-patterns

In primal joy 
Of a hack-&-slash 

The boy swinging 
A giant sword which passed thru all uncontested

The boy spoke
'My dog

'I need to find my dog
'I pass my voice to you

The movement was hurried
But the pace of endurance  
A steady of subborness
That carried a hopeless-heart
Tho defeated unable
To move on to any other action

Plants plenty burst a warm slushy tastfulness of sticky goo Ben was sure was an intoxicant
Each bite was gorgeous but none allowed him a sense of fulfillment

The boy stopped to make a impatient-questioning-gesture

'Dogs
'Dogs logically gravitate 
'Towards high corners in a dome
'Like the one ahead of this gorge

'Echoes will seem 
'To originate from each large-corner 
'The corners will draw the dog naturally 

Jordan came to mind
'The dog will have made a path this dense
'Your hack-n-slash tunnel will be easily
'Distiguishable from the dogs

Ben came to mind
'The more corners you check
'The more opportunites for the dog
'To come across & catch your scent

The epiphany
A burst of joy to the boy

Unexpected 
With a sudden bloom of hope

Unexpected a laugh in a quiet-room
Todd rudely severed in a rush

That knocked him upward

With a force
Todd bolted up still-cuffed

000000 BEN    00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Darkness 
Darkness but a candle

No he was turnt towards 
Dark-walls of glass
Walls partitioned by of different colors

Hands worked fast
Over many keyboards 

Keyboards laid all over
On the massive workbench
Which faced the walls

Lurching about in a roll
The man would wheel him-self about
In long-habitual-paths

clickity clack clak 

Colorful code displayed 
On various terminals

Each reviewed over & over

Ben could follow and understand some logic
Tho it was in the syntax of an alien language

Characters would pour down the wall as waterfall 
Each to fill him with satisfaction never-so-deep

The man would scan then
Immediately push-on 
To the next station 

Ben digested the code & comment passively
The man gave no immediate signs of listening
But at times a slight pause of typing

The man went to a tube 
He dide a yoga-pose to inhale weed
Thru a box-vaporizor on the bench

'Give me guidance 
'I have gone
'As far as I can 

With a swift habitual movement 
His hands made sign

Thumb connected to last two-fingers
Second & Third up hard

The man took a razor 
He cut out a symbol in the wood of the workbench

sun-pose => fall => inhale-smoke-rise => hand-sign => lower-exhale
_

Ben's eye jerked open 
Darkened by Todd's-shadow-siting-up

The fire longsince-burnt-out 
Ben was cold under a bright moon

Many future long-time-coffee-session
In semblance of that night's style

Work 
Every second a drag

New customer
Same complaint

New room 
Same mop

In & out 
Dreary-life

Forced to system
With no escape

Pentance
Guilty of poverty
child-of-the-state

~Believe in yourself
~You can survive alone

~Take heart & leave this all behind
~Your older brother can go to hell for steal'n your last paycheck

~Boss here is a one-of-a-kind-muthrfkr

~Use your next paycheck towards

~All will work itself naturally

It took a few years
For the right time
For that advice to be followed

Jewels was radiant
Under sunrays that sparkled off her light-amber-hair

Her eyes emeralds
Her wet tongue 
A mirrored frame

The bike hopped 
Rail-to-wall-to-flip

Trail'n sparks
To grind on the sign

The person shouted partly aroused 
There a deep well of sexual desire

He looked down a roadbike-cleats 
Clicked metalically back to the bike
As soon as he controlled himself 

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

All awoke together 
But all felt the exit natural 

Time was null
The quantum past 
Traditional lines of perception

'This symbol here 
Ben redrew the polygon sign
The man etched-in-the-work-bench

'I need to tatoo this on my knuckles

Jewels poked with a sunbleached fish-bond
Steadied-by-her-lack-of-empathy-for-pain

Dipped in root of an herb
& Ink of octopus 

The diagram beautifully portrayed upon Ben's left-fist
Augmented by the artistic-mastery of Miss 

A simple-but-intricate masterpiece was made
The black-symbols turned to light-brown-red under the sun

The project became an ordeal which never stopped
Symbols & Shapes expounded from knuckles up the arm
Amplified in patterns of certain-dreams
_

Friday night 
Sabbath of longsufferring-adventures

Rites of fume induced sleep 
Their sleep the night-prior

Dunes dawns before fire
Started by the first one up
Busy by necessity of the cold

The nights would be warm
Felines in hundres lay on them
You move off another
Another comes in for the replace

Little warm-fluffs
As blanket like net
Connected the five 
In a web of heat

Wakeful dusks set calm-stages 
Passive scenes for their day-to-day actions 

Adventure returned them to the city
The migration was as flock in tune with the season

Spot to spot to new spot
When seperated they all would meet
At the next spot

They didnt have much
Because they had to always
Carry everything in a pack on their back
Riding-long or walking-far
_

Water wasn't plentiful at the Dunes
Nor was the enviornment kind to plants

Miss kept on Jewels to grown her own plants

Massive acres of farmland 
Ideal places to find a remote acre

A hidden cultivation of plants 
Irrigated & undr-sun

Power of wild-plant-magik
Unlocked thru engeries 
Of service given to the plant
To reap only fruits 

Fruits plucked
In a state of affection

Sexual-pain
In orgasm of the pluck
_

Jewels nurtured month-old-plants
Each now nested on the bikes

Tonight was ride to die
These plants finding home

Or they would die
Aun in the ride home

Jordan trailed a one-wheel-trailer 
He rode low & heavy
Pimp-position kept off high-winds 

Agitation on the plants 
Unavoidabley to scar them with a sense of insecurity
Roots would grip with a steadfastness of experience
To empower them on peaceful plains 
_

Across town & down endless-roads

Each truck passing honking 
Calling them out as strangers

Rolling together as pack 
Holligans up to no good

The plants probably drugs
_

Hours passed
Into moonlight

Jewels finally stopped 
Jewels arms skyward outstreched
Soaked in the energy
Of arrival to a wishful-place

Miss affirmed with air-of-pride
'Yes 
'Deep-water in the air

'Jewels your ability is second-to-none
'You dear gem

Bikes were stashed inside the overgrown-roadside-drainage
Jordan always covered them with a dark tarp
He locked the set with his handy-chain

'The bikes will leave an obvious trail
'If we move careful passerbys won't be able
'To disstinguish a path
'Open-fields as these
'All they need is a direction

Jordan was always up to his 
Practical-ingenuities that bore confidence
_

Jewels carried her pepper-plant

The strand her variation 
Based on the Witch's main-root

Peppers kept off parasites
Peppers helped keep meat
Leaves produced thick-smoke

10 Acres they walked single-file
Yet all of them infested with dark-red-ticks
 
Bugs bit at their salty-sweaty-bodies in a frenzy

A small hill loomed in the horizon 

The hill was a resivour 
Leakage made the path difficult

Muddy from slippage
Bit by crawlers & fliers 
Cut by serrated-plants

Thru a path decades old

Jordan pointed at rusted-hinges 
Once a gate now they easily hurdled

Signs of long-abadonment

An old camp chair 
Next to a rusted-thru-tin-bin 
Full of decades-old-crushed-beer-cans

Strewn about were odds-that-spoke-of-a-person
Who kept this place as private-quarters 

Miss commented still worn from the journey
'It must have been miserable-fool 
'If this parcel-of-Hell a lounge

'This is definitely manmade
Jordan said assured 
Tho molds of the hill that had longsince-become-organic
'The plains-dirt causes this shit-pit
'Its without cohesion to contain the water by any account 

They twisted & curved 
Blazing a path up

Plants thick & greedy for space
Full of things that crawl & bite

Foliage 10-feet-high at places
Broke a grassy knoll at summit 

Impossibly-larger than what-looked-possible-from-below

A dark plane circle
Flush with the ground 

Miss had a habit of annoying them with her poetry
'A hole too dark 
'To be ventered carelessly

'Reflection mirrors shock 
'In soft ripples of darkened-waters

'Full-harvest-moon
'At perfect reflection

'No buzz of bug
'Nor intrusive plant 

'Pristine portal
'Transmits reflections

She explained 
'The Downtown Memorial architect
'Once described the difficulty of the process 
'To engineer a water-mirror

'proof of mastery
'Where his words

The untamed-grass held a lush kentucky green
Cool & soft 

Blades of it clung as a moistured-gauze
The face of it - a balm 
To tired, bit & sun-baked-flesh

Two hours past in careful movemetns
The four turned up the entire bank

The removed grass replanted
So beautiful the summit vegetation

Jordan went & grabbed 
The barbque-pit from its decades-of-shelter

Jewels did a rite over
metals, wood, mineral-rocks

In flame of the pit
In the smoke of the rite

Plants first incensed
Next planted 
Rite materials embedded at the roots

Plants accustomed to the manmade-waterhole
At that rest
Upon cooling-blades

One after the other
Taken by sleep

All looked across to other
Each sat legs-crossed 
Settle in a balance past-comfort 

A large wick candle blazed-crackily
Mint perked-attention of the passangers 
A small stove-pit boiled a couldron 

A omnious sound 
Isnt-at-first-heard

It crept upon their awakening concious 
Till it stood before their sense full-frontal

'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh

The words melded as their minds
Tho try as they might could not
Make out meaning to the chants

All were sync'd of mouth

Jewels eyes burst-widely-open
Looking up the the clouds
Where the five lingered

! the arrival

'3 long years we
'Chanted for thee

'Many have come & gone
'But only of you we seek

'I am the Grand Prophet
Jewels spoke in a firm beauty
Adorned by all-fine-things

Her red-hair more gold
As is a new sunset

A tiara laid in fine
Jewels & workmanship 
fish-bones, pearls & worked-gold

'My kin we have exchanged our voice
'To set out in call to draw you together

'My voice is true & worth their sacrifice
'A monks-life not wanted by any

'As sacrifice to bless infinite-realms
'We beseeched thee 
'Aid in meeting

Suddenly the world 
Became a brew as when
All finally turned-together 

In the meld they could only make out
'Thru your reality to infect all of our realities
'All efforts ever made by this Earth's existence will be null
'You must stop it

The world righted 
In a drastic move

The five face-front Jewels
'Prepare
_

All woke slowly
Entranced by chant

The sound heavy
To keep sleep

Dryness-of-mouth 
Eyes welled by deep-tears-of-agony

Each across the other
Sore of crossed-legs

They drug themselves heavily
To the banks of of the resivour

Not for hours did they speak

Jewels too put-out
To setup a healing-vapor

All of them put-out 
Passed-out on-and-off

Unable to sleep deep
The pain ever-present-misery
_

Miss still slept out-cold

The instant Jewels woke 
Miss collapsed of exhaustion

Jewel still bore a hard-amount
Of dried-caked-blood in her throat 

The trance had lasted
Two days & nights

Pulled from body
Towards the bridge-connection

A powerful Jewels
Dealt them great harm 

To wretch them 
So wickedly
A suffer-unparallel

With no food
They were forced
To make the laborsome-journey
To Jordan's nearest location

Contemplating the message
That cost the agony

Miss now a broken form

Oldage's greatest-shock
Is experiencing a new-kind-of-hell

Saggy as a tumorous rasin
Each full of pity
For remembered-wrongs against her

Two-weeks-torment ferried Miss to death's gate 
Waning Harvest Moon 
Tide as never seen 
Great waves splashed tears 
All around a ceremonial-pyre

Miss in the comsic-burial
Of the flame

Drift-wood piled high
Gulf wind as great engine
The flame strong all night

Themselves they found
Were ones greatest enemy

The next-winter-months 
Spent at the Library

Time-out-in-the-city
Only to hoard & return

Winter a bitter-time of sunless-days
Under a moist frozen canopy 
Passive to the paths of constant-northern-gusts

Jewels devoted her time into sign-language
Her loss-of-hope for a new tongue a silent-ache 

Sign-language an effort unnatural to her
Always awkward with her hands

The stiches were hard on her fine-movements

Aun boys out of patience
So strech was the task

She would often sign wrong words
The boys would go fulfill a random task

Hard or eazy-got
Jewels often in respose

? WTF
_

Once they thought she was pregnant
A topic only approached-with-jealousy
Till each admitted no to the other

Trials on-all-levels consisted of great-fights
To return-and-discover Jewels meant 

( peaches )

~\(;P)/'

_

The plants grew strong under care deepened by the empathy of a mourn
Soon amassed a great-greenery at the top-of-the-knoll

The trip was taken twice a month
To tend to whatever the ecosystem needed

The pond soil rich & warm to company
They errected a sand-bag-wall-barrier
That hemmed the greenery in security
_

All felt a calling near 

They would get a message soon
Today invited the experience 

0 united 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

They woke at the chanting pond from-before

Jewels aged-silver
At the pond chanting

The others each could only-feel the others-presense

In the same over-view overlooking the Prophet
She lead the weary chants

The same tune  
Only the words now audible

'Dagon the dragon
'Is coming thru you

A message natural
Their corporal bodies in-tune
Said-&-heard-thousands-of-times

Jewels burst emerald-orbs-up-at-to-them
The voice cracked in a way unaccustomed to many words

'You will lose your battle against Dagon
'But you will live to kill Dagon's Image

'Each reality Dagon links an Image 
'If killed in one reality
'Dagon's state is transferred to the Image in a previous realm
'Infinity upon infinity

'If Dagon's previous-state-link destroyed 
'And 
'Dagon killed in the next realm passed into

'The chain would fail 

'Dagon's reincarnation obstructed
'The effect is only theortical 
'Only if to reset to an Image past your reality

'A definite victory
'Dagon's link to our realitys
'Again returned to an impassable distance

'Lot fated to fail 
'Learn to survive  
'We will teach you
'The path of impossible-vengence
_

They burst forward
Laid in circle

They recovered in their tent tarp
All preset for the call

Chili-tea brewed with herbal-leaves
Able to sustain them quickly to normal-state
_

Symbols
A major part of their life

They would off-handedly-doodle DIAGRAMS

Stitched onto clothes
Flags to awaken a sleepy-passangers
With the alertness of remembrance
Symbol as anchor to keep their interaction in memory

Ben charged at the others
'This reality the gateway
'For a gateway 
'Between distance
'Quantum scale
'Definitely a thing
'A diety would exploit

'The Order has been around past centuries
'There is no 

~Rally the boys
~Off to war

'Dagon is coming
'Thru our cult-shit-reality

'The only logical move
'Would be an all-in
'To accomplish a task

'Cut the head

Todd stepped in
'We are fated to lose

He turned to the others
'Jordan will lead us off to someplace
'We will migrate with Jordan as lead
'To various places & in that way
'Be able to fulfill our rites

Jordan spoke up
'Imma side wit Ben
'Hear-up

'Caz some bitch-version-of-Jewels
'Tells us our fate we allow destruction

Todd looked back at them sold
'Cut out the head
'Break-the-system

Todd put out his hand

Jordan linked in
'Rambo rampage & shit

Ben put on his leather
'fk-the-world

Jules flipped-the-bird

Before bonefire 
In fast from want of food

Jordan lead them
'Our reality will be destroyed
'Who but us will be capable to forsee it

'We were told to survive
'What we are to do is get attempt ground-zero

'It will be the least tried possibilty
'Ground-zero can be the-eye-of-the-hurricane 
'Or it could be nuke-city

'That plan allows us
'Then to attempt

'To give out a hopeless warning

'That bitch believes in us

Jordan looked up with a face
Reserved before a long rant
'The nest of the hive
'Always centers a queen 

'Ice the bitch
'Revenge something

'We know the old school 
'We been there three-years
'Who over us best to break-in

'Besides it'd be something

-that- 
About Jordan 

The stuffed-giant-panda 
He loved-to-hump 
Left in his locker

Ben kept his network up 
His nodes only connected 
To local networks to siphon off data

The system of the University Hospitaled 
Had one key to backdoor all the data
All services used this same key

If enough traffic was sniffed 
A pattern had to emerge

That password would the backdoor-to-control-all-the-machines 
In this region

Computer Intelligence 
Life-long pursuit for Ben
 
Ben said to the group 
'Todd you never asked me 
'Why I was chased that day

All chewed roasted-pepperoni 
Gront of a bonfire in break-fast-feast

'I got access to all terminals at the entire school
'My dad flip-ta-bich-&-slappped-me-good 
'For that hack session 

'My dad came out to get me 
'To call me on the lie that
'I had detention till 10pm

'I didn't leave the lab 
'Where I planted the bots
'Till after 8pm
'I'd catch the last bus home & say I had to piss

'Cept for my dad had come out all concerned looking for me at an empty school
'Expecting to arrive as Knight in shine'n shit
'By the third-hour in front of the busstop he was pretty-welled-up

'Bots every-day 3am-5am
'All calculated 
'The region key 

'I got impatient 
'After a month I got desperate

'They kept us locked-down
'At the fkd-up school

'One-source of output
'Was a printer 
'Setup in the back of the janitors-closet
'The closet 
'Across from the Moniotor lounge 

'I counted & waited
'All returned after their trolls

'I was in the middle of the hall
'When that bitch-teach screamed

'Those goons caught me
'Right before that corner

'If that code is cracked
'Which it should be 
'Running for months now

'Going to that school
'I agree to be our most important task

'With that key
'All traffic would be plain-text to me

Ben patted at Jordan's arm
'Maybe we sell ourselves too short
'Who else in the fk'n city 
'Could get access like that

'Get the data
'Plant an encrypted-bridge

Jordan gave him a coy-cock-back
'Well if its so simple 
'Why hasn't anyone else done it 

Ben responded 
'I never said it was simple

Insomnia was the soil
Of Ben's childhood

Night was the time 
Dad popped-caps

If Ben didn't stay
Actively moving spots

Pops always managed to find him 
No matter how drunk he was

Popped-a-skull worse the-longer-it-took

So a decision to run 
Was a crossed-line 

Pops ranting about
The cost of those new school shoes

The ones kicked aside-disrespectfully
He would daily inevitably-trip over

He coulda ate McDonalds 
Not that shit-which for lunch
He would prepare on the way out

Ben easily avoided that clumsy lunatic 
His dad's favorite state-of-being

Ben used the time to read
He built lights in various places

'If you didn't mark it
'There was no point 
'Have'n to remember it
'Der dipshit
His dad would lecture him
'If there wasn't no point 
'Of have'n to remember it

'Then why the fuck 
'Would you read it boy

Ben looked up to his dad 
Despite his weaknesses as a father

Man cracked to the core
Stuck as single-parent-dad 
To provide all
In a hard world

His dad would steal textbooks 
From the city library
To show Ben how its done

Ben would wait in the car on 
Always rainy days

'Need a reason to stay hood'd up son
'Two coats to steal large

Gleaming as a proud man does 
When passing down a lesson-for-the-ages

Wet all around
But the books well-protected

Presenting two large textbooks of random sort
Out like he had just caught the starving-family food

Dad always taking Ben as ingrate
'Listen shithead 
'When you get the balls 
'That drop and the skills like mine

'Only then 
'Do you deserve 
'Which kind of fruit-of-the-tree
'You be able to eat

Ben's dad was a true muthrfkr

The type to fk around with you
Then leave you stuck with a babe for 2 yr

But with gathered courage to come back to raise him singlehanded
A fact that Ben would always use as pillar to keep the image of his father holy

Most the while being kicked around in day-to-day bullshit

Ben eventually took up the tricks of his dad 
That skill hoarded old unix books like hot-cakes

Black-screen 
Command-line-terminals

For those who want to stay close to the kernel

Same enviornment on all computers
His cloner on a small-silver-usb

His dad got it for his birthday
'Shit you never know
'When shit gets real

'Cops be busting in
'We heard you ~oink ~oink

'They search of evidence
'And where is the USB
'Full of all the evidence?

'4 Inches out of the puter

'But that lil-guy 
'Man you could swallow that
'By the time the even saw you

'All incriminating-evidence 
'In your shit

His dad was smart 
In his fox-down-to-earth manner

Each year Pops needed less alcohol

His dad began to regret 
Teaching the skill to steal

'Learnt is fine 
'But boy tell-you-me 
'no MAn would choose 
'that bull-onie-bull-shit
'for some-real-life-skills

'----like that fkn cop'
'----like your bitch ma'
'----like ....'

'lets see anyone else 
'Takeover a hole region's traffic

Ben said accidentally 
Interrupting the silence
Before meal in a time of fast

Food cool'n to cold in front
Busy in meditation 
Of some stationary task

Ben on a laptop
Jewels would knit 

Todd would write down histories 
Jordan would keep the fire & cook

Starvation-bonds are exploited 
By the effect of pseudo-starvation

Hunger among smells-of-food will quick-trigger 
A state of pseudo-starvation
To trick the mind to get that food at all-costs

The state of starvation
Allows the host to be more receptive
Aun hear the voice of an Active Passanger

All would be destroyed
First their reality
Dagon would portal onwards
In Quantum consumption 
Reality after reality
Till all possibility scarce
But the Image of Dagon

The Image some type of state
That Dagon can fill as a vessel upon death

Proving the portal can be crossed

If the link strong enough to pass a god
Surely be capable for us four

'We will use Quantum portal against it

Their perpetual states of deterination
Allowed them full imersion of their practice
Food at hand & Time to spare

It was difficult at times
When to attribute a work
To yourself
Or as product 
Of a silent-passanger

Ben as Jordan
Kept it real his entire life

Day to him
A finite time
Which to complete a project

Quantum realities 
Benefit all as one
& One as all

Each action feeds into many-experiences 
Impulse understood as active-passanger

This heavy thought passed 
Them two days fast as a call for all for aid
In pleas for energies & inspirations 
To be sent out for their purpose

They seemed as students
To masterful-hands 
Ghostly teachers
Lessons only in whispers

_

All agreed with Ben
To destroy a god is a rare chance

To succeed would then 
Elevate themselves as gods

Only gods can destroy gods
