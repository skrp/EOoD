###### ESOTERIC ORDER of DAGON

! Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers lining empty-halls

15 Minutes past the bell
Point-of-no-return to class

Any student this late gets writ-up
Ironically worse than not arriving to class at all

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail

His purpose in the basement
Below, front the door he planned to open 

Latency became mounted by endless-anticipation
Energy from day-dreaming now a hurdle
Aun compelled him towards the opposite direction

Thump of Todd's feet steady
Step-after-step up stairs to higher floors

A peace appreciated
A place only-ever bustling

The few rays of sun bore thru
Only to expose dust-polluted air
_

Mellow ambience shattered
Patters of running-feet charged towards his direction
From around the corner

Fortune placed Todd directly-opposite the girls-restroom

Distance leapt in one bound
He rushed to the last stall

Todd let out a cocky smirk
An instictual-ingenuity to hide in the girls

!! KAK

Cracked-seat Todd stood atop broke
Left-foot plunged ankle-deep into hour-old piss & shit

Door quietly opened
Someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled-yell came from the hallway
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

!! BOOM

Heavy-legs-kicked-open-near-cracked-the-door-in-half

The unexpected-fright broke unprecedented-pressure into full-release

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSS
!!! PPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP
!!! PPPPPLLLLQQQQQQIIIPPPLLLUUUUKKKKIII

Entire school vibrated
Eruptions of great-masses expounded essays

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN
!!! YOU SHOULDA SAID WHY
!!! YOU NEEDED tHe gah hiRls

A schoolhall-monitor hooted out for-the-entire-building-to-know
Announcement gagged-quiet
Gas particles bloomed-out in a thick cloud
_

Room silent after the door fell shut & resettled
All walls of the building rumbled in giggles

!! PAT
!! PAT
!! PAT

Ben kicked at the stall door braced-shut by legs
'Gonna make your fat-cunt-trap
'Eat that shit you scabby-bitch

Todd stepped out of the stall
'Back off

Ben turned to him more crazed

! YOU

Todd swiftly tackled to the wall
Slamming hard as his soaked-foot slipped-out

Ben muffled as he took-revenge
'You are the reason I got chased

'walk'n around
'like you weren't 
'skipping class

'a teacher notified
'the monitors and got me chased down

Todd maneuvered using Ben's force against him
Set forearms placed Ben in a locked-hold

After several curses & a long pause Ben surrendered

'Alright asshole
'You made your point

Todd pushed Ben off to a safe distance
A toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that
Jordan blushed-out the awkward introduction
'Im sick

He scruffed his unkept thick brown hair into a fluff
His habitual-mechanism to divert attention

Momentarily all content with breathing the compressed-gas in silence
_

Walls washed white layer-after-layer
Extenuated by dark recesses between the tiles
Unable to conceal deep-red marked graffiti symbols

Piss marked all to a feminine territory
If only the stain but mostly the smell

Curiosity here only met horrors
All repelled from investigations

Ben broke the silence
'This place is kinda creepy

Hot-box-gassed-up
No where to go until the class period ended

A sound tickled Todd's ear
An enchanting burr at the tail-ends of the echoes

Before he realized he was interested
Echoes drew him closer to the wall

Todd startled then reaffirmed

'There is a hum
'Sounds like a whimper
'Can you hear it

Jordan put in as he neared
'Probably a god-damned-ghost

He yelled at the trash-can playfully
'School is hella-haunted
'sk-a-dick Bettsy burns-the-dick

'back in the 50s ...
Jordan started his story

Hum came from the metal-box next to the trashcan
Rust smeared as Todd opened the lid for better acoustics
Vent dropped to darkness

Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

( need help help please help )

The sound came softened from great distance
In a fullness-of-scream that rips apart throat-lining

Communication faint
Todd looked to the others for confirmation

( help us    please )

Jordan ventured between Todd & at the vent yelled
'Here
'we are here

'Where are you

( can you hear me  hello please help )

Jordan continued
'We hear you
'We will get the Principal

!!! nnnneeeeeeehhhhhhoooooooooooo

Shriek took all three back in a tight terror
Pitch-to-curl-ear-hairs in absolute revolution

Todd opened the lid with both his hands to shout down

'Who ever you are
'Where ever you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately, others followed dazed
To them it seemed a reckless commitment

At 10-min-to-the-bell the hall is at its most empty
Policy prohibits anyone out-in-the-hall

Trio made their way without obstruction
All Monitors back in their lounge on the couch

Todd led them confidently down lower floors

'I discovered a secret passage behind a door
'When I got lost my first-year fire-drill

'All year I been trying to work myself
'Up to this before graduation

'No chance ever came
'So today I promised
'Id make it happen

Todd only-one-he-knew who had seen the long-corridor
Despite years he still believed in what he had seen

'Since first-year
'I been planning how explore it

'Today is too much for coincidence
'A secret door will lead us to her
'I am certain

Todd now empowered by rambunctious company
Three boys followed the stairwells down
A small pack not-to-be-fucked-with

On-the-move breaking all violations
All-in since they left the girls

Todd continued as they rossed lengths of halls of the first year students
'When I got lost

'I felt someone calling out to me by-name
'I followed
'Tho less-than-a-handful knew my name

'I found a door at the end of the hall
'It was unlocked
'At first I only peaked in out of curiosity
'Hard to say no to exploring with a rep like Discrol

Jordan jumped in
'Trust me you dont know most of it
'One story 

Todd annoyed kept on his same train of thought
'But at the back of the closet
'A light-source instead of shadow

Jordan perked in interest
He let Todd continue without offense

'I had time to wander so I entered
'I discovered a long corridor

'The path went ahead for a long time
'It ended at a black hole in a wall

'I am sure it leads down
'But I forced myself to go back
'Before I got near enough to know

'Goddam-creepy-place

Todd looked ahead determined
Pent-up-forces now unleashed propelled him forward unstoppable

Thru the hall towards the basement
Moving around windows
One-at-a-time ninja-like till they got near gym-lockers

Jordan expounded
Stirred with the brisk walk

'Shit-man
'Most my papers for school
'Were all about school history
'Lame-as-fk-mate 

'Yo tho 
'One caught me like

!daymn

'At Downtoan-Library
'People all WTF
'You shoulda been there
~classic

'But the article caught me unexpected
'Bored, but try'n to look like
'I wasn't only there for the roof

'Im thumb'n thru all these papers from the start
'Research'n the first instance Driscol got famous

'This floor is the only basement
'Right so with that-in-mind

'This article
~blow-your-mind-man

'A boy found pieced-up
'In a fishy cult ritual

'Im like some lil muthrfkr
'Put this pulp in tryna-act-smart

!daymn
'Newspaper
~solid-legit

'The article said the janitor
'Alerted authorities from across the county
'They almost hung-up on him as nutt-case

'But then they heard him
~get-eaten-da-hell-alive

'Fleshy sounds & munching
'Huge masses of people chanting

'Man screaming 
'Kept alive past possible

'PoPo from all over the county stormed the place

'That shit all happened 
'according to multiple statements in the newspaper
~on-muthrfkn-second-basement-floor

'First I took it considered Uni Hospital first-floor
'But then I remember from a previous research paper 
'This building only had two floors 
'Over ten years later the Uni built over the school

'I tried to correspond
'But nah nothing man

'We are talking total-silence 
'Newspapers for the entire month
'All gone missing

~she-he-it-son 
'Archive a national data-bank

'Only a physical copy I was holding
'So I stole that shit & now its framed
'One day might be worth fat-wads

Ben nodded legit-approval
_

Each panting hard after traverseing three-floors
Nervousness strained fibers of the soul

Driscol topped global abduction statistics
Prisions less locked-down than the students of this school

Silence for a time broken
Ben countered at the steamroll-logic

'I been here all 3 years 

'If there were multi-basement-levels
'There would be some proof

'A reworked stairwell
'Modified to only move up

'I been on both sides
'The main-wells

'They as old as Miss Finely

Jordan added revrently 
~may-the-cunt-bitch-rest-in-peices

Ben kept speaking

'With three basements structural-columns
'Cant be erased-off-no-mark

~fk-more-so

'All second-floor ceilings are mangled-patchwork
'From the Uni construction

Ben accentuated with a pointed finger

'Uni had way more money & that job still crap

'You both believe that a stairwell could just disappear
'These stairwells created by god on the 8th-day for fks-sake
_

A closet door tucked to the exterior-wall at the far-end 
Past the last classrooms isolated 

Todd approached the door window
All transpired as domino-effect of past choices

Small window exposed a narrow janitor closet
Todd's sweaty palms slid on the locked knob

Light kept on
Exposed a definite century-old-wall to the beack of the closet

Despite countless proofs human-heart only ever ready to doubt
More confirm all-else besides what his experience told him
All momentum fell flat on its face as mis-step 

Jordan knelt in front and took off his pack
~got-dat

Jordan retrieved a pouch and door open
Pack back on Jordan's back before the other two could follow the action

Jordan not dismayed by Todd forelorn-face-of-loss
After two quick-movements the back-wall of the closet opened-inwards

Jordan chuckled pointingto the round scars on the floor that traced the swing of a door

'Todd you shoulda seent yer face yo


Narrow-corridor revealed to turn down a very-long-hallway
Corridor followed the exterior wall of the building

Single-file on eerie currents of certain course 
Irreversible alterations defined life
Endorphins flowed in bounty of oft-asked-questions

Ben admitted
'This is the real outer wall

'I always thought it odd
'There no small windows
'In any of the rooms in the basement


'The Fire Marshall
'Got the school on fire-code

'Rather than expose this wall
'They built that new northside-stairwell

'Whole week the Firemen escorted people up to Uni 
_

Walls made of pilgrim-brick
Large, thick & dark-purple

Brickwork technique lost
Pilgrim-bricks most now all sold-off or stolen
A marvel-of-it surrounded them in bare tunnel

No back doors to any classrooms 
Only to continue long-passage after long-passage
_

End came up abruptly as a blank wall

Todd went busily to search for the door from his memory

Ben chirpped

'The architect must have been a comedian

Jordan countered

'Or hide access
'To an entire level in a closet

'Pilgrims times
'The bay too huge to defend

'Before all them well-to-do-fk-you-fucks
'Bought up all bayside lands

'Back pirate times 
'Bay a scary place to be

'Everyone with guns & knives
~sure-as-shit-sticks 

'Pirates raided every year
'Roy Miller Path
'Arcs right with this school at its head
'As far as any raider ever went
'Often to kidnapped kids

'Thats why we have the motto
'Once a Buc
'Always a Fk

Ben thought he knew school history
He only vaguely heard people talk of what Jordan said

Ben noticed on the old bricks
Symbols carved in peculiar diagrams
Sprawl of it typical of graffiti

Todd busy searching for the door
Finally his nails scraped along a fine-line 

Jordan moved him out of the way 
He went at it with a thin steel-bar

Ben jolted

'How do you manage to get that thru entry-clearance

Jordan's eyes lit in a smirk
He put he bar to Ben's face to inspect the lines & numbers

Ben replied only half convinced
'Security really believes you use it as a ruler

Jordan laughed
'Its more believable in its bag next to my pencils & calculators

Peeled-paint revealed a metal door
2ft above-the-ground 3ft high-and-wide

Jordan turned to them for-real

~she-he-it-mug

'We get caught back here
'Gonna be us screaming

Jordan gave the truth in a stare

'Think some rag-hoe
'Next period hearing our screams
'Gonna do the same for us

'Best-recognize

'Might as well go all-in
'Right from the start

Jordan patted his bar on palm confidently

Todd took the bar from Jordan

'Maybe I should hold onto it

Jordan only looked at his hands
He felt betrayed by them 
So swift & sure Todd's action

Jordan raised an eyebrow
Content to let Todd do the rest of the work

They all helped pry the hinges into creaked-submission

Todd always knew this went down
Now he saw into the black depths

The door had the lock from the inside
It fell down the shaft in distant bangs for a long, long time

Jordan let out down the shaft

'Pilgrims paranoid muthrfkrs

Ben behind spoke at Jordan

'Wouldn't you be

Jordan smirked back

'be? 

'Im worse

'My locks may bend
'But they never break

Ben didn't know how to place the remark
Unsure if Jordan full of the shit his slang promised
_

Dark musty air flowed immediately to them & up
Strong-as-a-gulf-breeze
Hot as furnace vent

Something caught Todd's eye
He poked at it with the bar

Elevator-cords hung mid hidden by darkness

'If there are 3 basements
'Then there are only two floors to explore

An exchange of glances agreed compliance

Jordan looked casual
Ben would not back down

Todd reached with extended-arm and grasped the cord
'Reach out with both hands
'& Commit

Todd let himself be drawn into the darkness
He left them with a confident smirk
He prepared for this

Todd fell to the deep
In an unstoppable-slide

!!! HAILMARYFULLOFGRACE
_

All dark
Distance only abstract 

Movement only testified by the-burning-of-his-palms
Sweat-sprung as will-fought-for-life

To grasp a frictionless cord as skin yeilded to muscles

Todd ventured his legs out
He managed to stop himself into near splits

Thank-the-Father
He did morning-prayers today

Other two screamed frantically down

!!! TODD

Todd looked up
Door only a small smudge of silver in a infinity of dark space


'Im okay
'Im okay

'There is oil on the cords
'I should have expected it

'Gonna take off my shirt
'Use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

Ben asked without idea on how to back up the offer

'Do you need help up

Todd fearless began to climb at a controlled rate

'Its best only one person
'Be on the cord at the same time

'Im gonna try
'To find a door
'To get to one of the floors

'I fell pretty far
'So Im guess'n up

Cool protection of the shirt
Skin-peel-palms grateful-past-pain

Best course to climb up slowly
To ensure he could get back up

Todd felt for the door with this feet
He spat out iron-tainted saliva

'Old oil

The slide down cleared off most the oil
His covered-hands now had clean purchase

Only sounds of his labored breath & swells-of-air
Gusts came intense, rising in heat from deep-darkness

Todd felt a gust on his stomach
It hit sideways & cool

He stomped out the outline of the door

! TWANG
! TWANG

A beam bore into the darkness

'I think

! I found it

One hand felt for a handle
Door the cold of metal 

!! POMP
!! POMP

Todd stomped the corner down
He pulled himself higher
Kicking-down until the door gave way

He pulled himself into the dusty grey hallway
At the end of a long corridor

'Im off the cords
'Come down

'Wrap your shirt around your hands
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Jordan challenged

'Best just stay back
'Something get loose and fall
'Right into your face

Ben & Jordan followed down & swiftly entered

Ben, last, climbed inside scraping his knee
Looking up saw Todd & shrieked back falling-on-his-ass

! FUCK

Todd covered in dust-caked-dark-blood-mud
Blood not oil had been on the cords

Smears left where Todd had touched himself
Jordan hadn't taken much notice of it
_

Silver of the dust repeated available light

Forward in a cautious manner of adventure
Level an abandoned fully-equipped-hospital 
All lay as if unexpectedly sealed off

Electricity still flowed on this floor
Emergency-signs gave enough light for them to move secure

Jordan spoke in a whisper

'move & stay
'think first

Jordan in front with hand up for them to stop
He crouched down & motioned the other two low

'look at the ground
'each movement leaves time-stamped direction

Both caught in admiration of their newfound companion
Jordan broght them to a crossroads of halls next to a room

'look close 
'each hall & the room

Jordan's finger traced out-lines of different levels of dust-layers
Careful to keep to his rule to not make extraneous movements

'I cant tell the exact days
'Only the relative difference in traffic 

'this is the main hall
'the path has thinned down 
'compared to the hall there we came from

'compare it to inside the room
'No traffic goes there

'this is how we can know where to go

Inside a room an overturnt bed
A familiar form lay half-sprawled

Ben entered to draw down a corner of dust-layered blanket

A husked-corpse exposed what left of a face
Sweet smells stung their noses

! twang

Ben recoiled back flipping a metalic bedpan
Kicked-up cloud of long-since dried-up urine & fecal matter

All froze to the simple horror 
Death the expectation of failure

Ben's face captured shame & apology

! bap
! bap bap

Main hall echoed meaty wacks
Each nearly shit-themselves

! aaaahhrrrrr
! eeekkkaahhggggggggggggg

Distant defiant cry gurggled into silence
Jordan herded them into the room

Each took a corner of the blanket they lifted 
Thick-settled-dust of the blanket flung over their tracks partially-covering the treads from the shaft
_

Boys huddled in the room
Corpse for company

Green of the blanket stained silver by the dust
Respectfully laid back over the dead-body

Day had long-since numbed their nostrils
Sweet-smell now lost

After time passed Todd braved a whisper 

'Shaft went past the length of two floors

A question which none could answer

'Uni dumps the body-parts thru it to where?
'That explanation doesnt make much sense

Jordan spoke 

'Not much sense
'To have a hospital as a secret basement

'A-mid-evil sex-dungeon
~where-bad-kids-get-krumpus

'That would ease my sanity

'This obviously abandoned
'While in full-service

Todd whispered

'Doesnt make sense
'Water 
'Electricity

! snap

Ben lurched at the obvious fact he overlooked
He took off his pack & repursposed the blanket as tent

Plugged into power
Plugged into network

Jordan & Todd both third-wheel
Put on edge by Ben's rapid-fire-keystrokes

Risk-of-them-all-weighed-in-&-merited-by-one
Curse-the-free-will-of-others

Corpse stared back at them
Hair over-grown long as womans but sex lost to time

Jaw dangled stoopidly
Hollow eyes held a truth
Mystery to present company

Someone was trapped & beaten in the concealed sub-basement of the school
Authorities no-doubt do likewise to the trio of boys

The three boys huddled in a room on an abandoned-level, layers from escape
An elevator shaft the only known exit

Jordan an expert in these situations
Mousecraft
Sure ways only to go about these things

Patience & long-waiting
Until absolute vacancy established

Period-bells could still be faintly-heard
They waited for an entire period

Silence a time for meditation
Accept this drastic turn of Friday morn

Ready to decide upon actions with dire-consequences
_

Eyes & senses well-accustomed they proceeded to the main hall

Halls mirrored the logical-structure of school above
Main hall circled, outside & inner arrays-of-rooms

All watched for signs of frequented areas 
The fresh treads were not man-made

Jordan led them to a path taken daily

One head-of-the-path led to a stairwell
They followed the other direction towards a double-doored-room

Path to the entrance fresh

Todd & Ben hung back as Jordan looked thru a crack
Confirming no movement he motioned the others to follow

Stairs descended into a deep arena
Workstations arrayed each segment of stratus

Industrial-lamps draped over each stone table
Embedded shiny-rungs glinted the steel of restraint ports

Under each table
Various shelves for various instruments

Jordan's heart fainted

'All the tools
'In all these stations
'Down all the rows
'Polished from recent-use

Fresh paths led to a table at center-stage
Only table with its light on

A nude-red-headed-girl bound illuminated
Strapped to the table by a broad-leather-belt

So bruised her face
Impossible to see her freckles

Freckles covered her entire body
Freckled to the point 
Tho bloody, bruised & nude
Freckles the first characteristic noticed
Infinite constellations of cherry-colored-dots

Stitch-patch-closures covered her torso 
Patches appeared in similar fashion all over her body

Her shut-eyes sprang into maniacal-alertness
Two large yellow-orbs lit by fierce-fire

Three boys, not monsters, stood over her

Jordan immediately busy but unable to free any strap

'How do we get these loose

After no response yet exhausted of ideas
Confused past-exasperated he spoke to her square-on

'How
!daFKget
'These god-damn-straps-off

Idiotically loud 

Boys behind him idle & timid to horror intertwined with hormones

Jordan tilted hard
Girl who screamed earlier
Now won't speak to save her ass & theirs

She opened her mouth in wide-display
A mutilated-stump-of-a-tongue-in-a-wag

Stump freshly seared & gleamed with odd-gooish-sealant

A small muffled voice came to fullness

'Finally sorry
'I could not speak

'Hardly-breathe
'When she lays like that

The voice became more clear yet kept small

! Jewels

'Dont move like that neanderthal
'I need to get ready to introduce us

'A hundred years will teach you patience bitch
'You think I dont know what you are doing

Infantile hands forced its way out of a tangle of hair
A creature emerged from her shoulder

A shrunken-head emerged with drawn-back-smile
Two baby-arms attached under shriveled-ears curtsied
_

Trio aghast
A monster perched on the girl's shoulder

The little head replied indignant

'Yes this is a shock
'I understand ignorance

Jewels cast her face-to-the-side-ashamed
Nude & openly disfigured took over her predicament as most-painful

The little head made a-small-exasperated-sound

'How are you such a cunt all the time
'You expect these twirps to keep their shit
'With you crying about yours

! hhhmmmmp

'I can find you a new-tongue
'A longer one if you are into-that

'You had much worse
'Now no need to disrespect me

It turned to another bow & the little head tilted

'Miss the Countess


Jordan leant in between the two

~for-fks-sake
! we-gotta-skat-outta-here

The creature paused dancing a rod idly in the air

'The bands are one leather belt

'Hurry up

'There is not a second to spare

'Above our head you can release it

'Come on rodents
'Not a moment to lose 

'Jewels can't speak now
'& I can't read her mind

'But I can sense what she is feeling

'She feels ashamed of me right now

The puppeted-head trailed on

Jordan found the clasp to be odd-shaped
Only after ingenuity the leather-band released
Only with the help of the metal bar & 6 arms

Jordan's shirt the least dirty
Jewels wore it as a small dress

Miss had them make a measurement & a cut
Foremost to tailor the shirt for her-form

Demeanor of Miss had an instant way to blind the truth
Interacting with her as to-an-adult

Ben's shoes didn't fit Jewels only his socks

Miss rapped Ben as he knelt to re-lace the shoes
Rod extended to a painful twang resonated in his skull

'We need to hurry
'If they come back soon
'Each one of us will be strapped again
'All the worse for let

Promptly they made exodus out the devilish auditorium

Lght had a cruel elderly-tint-of-aged-desperation
Rays followed them in a-haunting-fashion as-if-pointing-direction
Vengeful what themselves had accepted must be fated-true unto-all
_

Elevator cord now clean enough to allow them quick-access back up to the basement
Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their predicament

Todd smeared all over in blood
Thin-streams ran down his face like bloody-tears

Jordan shirtless
His odd-shaped-belly buldged-out

Ben caked in dust

And finally there Jewels

Ben admitted despair

~how-in-hell
'We going to get out of school
'They are going to know where we have been immediately

'Put us back down here at all costs

Jordan wailed back
~yeah-it
'They will just say
'It another god-damn-drill

'Shit happens like every couple months

Todd opened the closet door & walked into the school hall

'I have a plan

Five freakish forms moved together
Obvious & trapped in the basement of a locked-down-school

Todd had a pre-planned route of exit

Dusty
Shirtless
Pantless
Bloody

They broke into the hall cast from horror
Sharply outlined to a monotony-of-normal-scenes
View more contrast by their outlandish forms

At the end of the hall a teacher stopped her lecture
She opened the door and yelled

!!! MONITOR
!!! MONITOR SECTION 7

!!! 459

The call for any who heard to plaster against hall-windows
Only a limited section for viewing

A mosh-pit of greedy-kids starved for 1st-hand-account 
Marinated in day-dreams from revels of the earlier shit-show

Several girls touted the hideous state of the infamous toliet
Some kid Ben had obliterated 

Main attraction like a relic in a church
Girls recounted their impression always to curious gatherings of students

Up on lunch-meal-meds now in a riot
Each young-heart feral

Phantasms spectated only by larger-classmates
Teachers in this way barred from executing proper protocol 
_

Todd led them around the corner to rush up the stairwell

Two large Monitors stood as sentinels
Locked-down-in-protocol at the main-exit

!!! MONITORS
!!! SECTION 1

!!! 459

Both voices boomed

Todd already passed the hall turnt leading them across the level to stairwells
Movement looked like Todd's plan failed to the other four
Yet the aura told a confidence never-the-less relied on whole-heartily 

There no time to explain
Only for Todd to choose and the rest to follow
_

Cross the school in this method
All Monitors drawn to the wrong location

Their exit higher-up school-levels
Not at the ground-floor as expected
_

Every window filled
Every door blocked

Curious-children stirred by shouts
Starved-sights of spectation
Charged by an eventful-day

Teachers more scared of the fight-pits
Than to do their duty

This factor allowed the five to reach the second-floor unhindered
_

Jordan pulled out his metal-bar
'Now is the reckoning
'Suggest yall wake-up likewise

They passed the restroom of the morn
Towards the window at the end of the hall

Todd took out a key from his pocket
He unlocked the window

'Just do what I do
'Go where I go

Each climbed outside onto a narrow ledge

Sun shone hotly burned hotter their exhaustion

Four-odd-bodies outside on the second-story
World outside too-busy-with-the-day to notice

Ledge continued to an adjacent roof
They crossed over to a high-branched tree

Branch overhung onto the roof in an entangled attachment

By those means they climbed down to ground-level
At the back of the school
_

Onward into alleys towards less-traveled roads

Each of the boys knew how to pass-this-area without-being-seen
They ran tired but now on their-turf

Familiar with what fences led where
Up which buildings to what

Rat-true

Jewels only had a large shirt & Ben's sweaty socks
Ben carried her piggy back the intervals he could

Headed by Jordan, the other two at her side
This kept her mostly covered

Large-city-bustlers continued their way without heed
Four moved as a pack following Jordan's lead
_

They arrived at the edge of Downtown
Outskirts to the industrial-sector

Jordan turned them into an alley
& Thru a hole in a chain-linked-fence he loosed then bound back

They quickly entered thru an unlocked-window
Edifice as dusty as the sub-basement

Each cautiously followed Jordan's movements
Hopping from board-to-board
Trace with few tracks
Up the stairs to a room

Office building once a newspaper printery
Newspapers stacked in dusty-heaps

Jordan locked the room with a chain after they entered
He then pushed away a cabinet to reveal another chain-locked door

'This far from anyone
'Gotta be triple-sure
'So as to sleep

'Break thru one of these
'Loud enough to wake whatever sleep
_

An outside window exposed the endless ocean
Dust free & ocean breeze

Cardboard tatmi layered the neat floor

Jordan led them thru the outside window
The fire-escape was covered by patched-tarps

Floor a netted-metal
An escape rope coiled to a corner

Jordan pointed up

'Got a tank of rain water

'Open the spout
'& Close it with this knob

Jordan motioned them to turn around

'Aint clear-water
'But cleaner than you

He took a brisk wash in water heated-by-the-sun
Water splashed far below

Jewels & Miss to theirself
Front the window content with the bayside view

Endless ocean to the right
Left held the iconic skyline

Fresh air taken into grateful lungs
Peace long-lost now found in abundance
_

Ben asked Jordan
While waiting for Todd to finish

'So what is this place


Jordan looked-down as his face blushed
Laid out on the stitched-cardboard-mat 

'This is one of the places I live
_

All laid on layers of cardboard-stitched japanese-tatami
Refreshed & completely exhausted

Ocean gusts massaged their tense skin
All slept passed-out-till-next-morn

In safe slumbers
Soothed by the-sound-of-steady-waves
_

They all woke in the daze of a new life
Jordan fed them dried fruit & granola
Washed down with Mtn-Dew

'Got locations like this
'City wide

'I can go any where
'And find myself alright in an hour

'Tho this one is the nicest
'Each has a stash of all I need

Jordan closed the container & stashed the food-box in the closet

'Last week I got stuck across town
'Food there must have went bad
'So exhausted I cant remember eating

Jordan finished looking apologetically at Ben
All mostly forgotten by the day

!fk

Ben realized his predicament with this father
His father sure-cocked with a self-righteous beating

Saturday-morn from Friday-morn
Till now the trance finally woken

Jordan had a rummage-of-clothes raided from the downtown charity

Jewels head-to-toe with garments that mostly fit
She had hiking-sandals with wool stockings
Light-blue summer-dress only-a-little-too-short

Her & Miss  tailored the outfit
Repurposed-stockings for her forearms
Jills very sensitive about her arms

Miss always held a finely-made extendable-umbrella
To bar anyone from seeing what quick-to-hide

Jordan now wore a pocketed vest

Ben took an old-leather-jacket
He tied in a roll under his pack

Todd took a set of wool gloves for his hands
Very raw after his recleaning this morn
_

Jordan trailed their exit
Covering their tracks as they returned to the streets

'Take everything
'I never go to the same place
'In the same week

Ben needed to get to the pay-phone at the lower-district Circle-K

Day warming to be hot
Heat relaxed overworked-muscles
Warmed after a prolonged-stiff-sleep

Ben looked at Todd

'We only have enough for one call
'You mind if I use it

Todd complied

'I am the last-of-the-litter
'My parents wouldn't know if I was gone for a week

Pressing pace of life left Jewels & Miss to be sorted out
_

After 4 rings
Ben tried the oldman next-door

Old voice responded
'Heeh Hello

'Mr. Grinvix this is Ben

After no-response came

'I just wanted to call to ask
'If you see my dad
'Tell him I'm on my way home

Still only silence

'He isn't answer'n the phone

Ben waited awkwardly
Only the sound of heavy breathing

Old man finally spoke

'Your dad is dead boy

'Best get to the authorities
'Have 'em tell ya

Voice sympathetic but immediately hung up

Ben stood silent leaving phone to his ear
Flabbergasted from truth-revealed-lie

His dad would always be there

A jackass who tried hard to keep a light heart

To never-again hit him
Nor give him advice-no-other-could

A man regretful of being a father stuck with a son

Man enough to power thru the hardship
Too-often-than-not himself the cause

Ben physically-worked to come-to-grips
Understandings toppled down
Dazed among rubble

Four in silence left Ben space to wail
_

!!! PLUUPP
!!! PLUPPP

A police car had silently snuck up behind them 
Its lights now bright at their backs

'Alright you juuhhhh

Cop cut short as the pack immediately bolted

He turned & fumbled open the door
Which he preemptively shut

Today not a mood 

'Im gonna bust diaphrams
'fkn-lil-shit-fks

Officer called into his shoulder-piece

'Broc here
'I got a 281 on the Driscol 459
'Update the 459 is now a 499

Cop reversed sirens blaring
Actuator of the law of this land
Empowered by the level 9 code
Perpetrators better dead

Focus-as-predator never dropping target
In that negligence he was fused into Circle-K

An overworked-trucker backed by near a ton of Coca-Colas continued only mis-directed 
Police vehicle gripped in front 

An unstoppable mountain till the back wall of Circle-K 

Flesh crunched in sharp folds of metal
Dorito-chips soaked soggy as in salsa

Cop drowned under a cold-death of Mtn-Dew-Slurpee
_

Todd looked back in relief

Police must have been the result of Ben calling his neighbor
Timing on the cop made sense if dispatched from Downtown-Station

He pathed the pack the back way uptown
City knew their identities & placed to ambush them

Questions caught his throat
Grateful of the many more steps still to take before an answer

Todd led the exhausted group up the hills towards his home 
Ben learnt of his father's death
Krew traced & jumped by a now-dead cop

Ben kept black cloud 
Group kept silence 

If the death of Ben's dad related to yesterday
It would soon be known 

Horizon closer with each step & familiar-landmark
Silence prepares the way with comtemplation

Deep sleep of last night swept away traceless 

Entreched in labor with no timely solution
Acceptance of pain as the-state-of-being

Five-miles drew two-hours time
Under sun unabated by cloudless sky
_

Seagulls squaked 
Enjoyment of the uncomfortable position of beings the gulls envied

Tables turnt to the birds favor
What is toilsome for humans a lesiure birds

World continued careless
Inside cars disconnected from momentary-coordinates
Distracted by the thought of the destination 

Five souls suffering 
Unable to begin to voice the matters-at-hand

Full-capacity with present journey
Up hills looming over the Downtown bay
Favoring sidewalks with more shade

Normal world betrayed as an alien-state
Group so fused in the throes of turmoil
_

Miss broke the silence 
She stood up full height
Set her self a few mintutes then with-drew her umbrella to take stage

'I am Miss
'We have not formly met

'I already know your names
'No need to introduce again

Her finest white gloves covered the baby-hands
Irritated Miss continued

'Tho it would be polite

Communication took time to digest
After the miles of misery
They just continued dumbly

Miss only-by-concious-effort paitent

'I have been attached by operation to Jewels

Miss patted the ginger head with the rod to underline of whom she spoke

'Jewels offered our order
'The Esoteric Order of Dagon

'To introduce Dagon to the unanointed
'Is an oath-breaking death-sentence

Jordan smirked an interruption

'Everyone knows Dagons Eve

Miss visibly irked

'Then explain him in one paragraph

Jordan realized his concept of Dagon as an empty pinata

Miss amused continued 

'But I have the favor of the Seer
'So I may do as I please keeping-oathsworn

On the shoulder of the a sidewalk-less street
Pack crossed to a side walk of an office-complex

Miss able to set down the umbrella to focus more of her energy on explainations

Sure of what were only questions to Todd
Only able to derail the sorrow for a short-time

'Dagon is a cosmic god
'Infathomable & Unsaitable

'Earth is bribed to Dagon 
'As an occult offering 

'A sacrifice of this world
'& All worlds connected by Quantum-Entanglement

'In exchange for the bounty
'Past imaginations which gods bestow

'All Earth will be consumed
'Drained dry as Mars has been

'Blessings of omnipotent-powers-uncalculable 

'Some envision the gift of infinite-life
'Indesuptably to be as god themself

'I am one of those in faith of Dagon
'All worth the exchange of a god's blessing

'Jewels is the daughter of a wealthy family

'To pay the price of a family to join 
'Prime of their seed must be given 

'Truthful this binding an honor not a curse

'I am 400 years old
'But only a year as symbiotic member of Jewels

'As payment into the order 
'Past must live as youth

'Don't be fooled 
'I offer much

'I heal her & repair her
'Myself surgeon centries-in-experience

'I guarntee her life till old age & wise counsel

When Miss traveled to other parts of the body she burrowed
A fleshly-lump the size of a small-ball moved under skin 

Right shoulder her perch 
Baby-arms held the umbrella when not busy describing words
Entire puppet folded-up & tucked into a small hump on Jewels shoulder

'We worship the bowels of Dagon

'In Jewels inserted divine-microbials
'This the digestion of the gods

'When I an old woman we found the asteroid

'Tales of Eastern-Monks who under-tourture
'Guided us to a prophetized mountain-village

'Prophecy built on ancient astrology 
'& Deep-cosmic-mathematics could not compromise
'Nor be halted by mercy for ignorants 

Miss trailed off lost in that last statement

'Decades after mining the asteroid
'Lead to unprecedented discoveries

'Asteroid contained mavervelous gifts 

'Mound-of-Excrement of Dagon 
~holy-be-it-enternally

'Sadly only this small mass of me left
'When the bateria-microbials adjusted 

'Bacteria sentient of the well-being of the host as life-itself

'Jewels is stronger than all you boys combined
'Microbials refine all ingestion & internal-assimilation 

'I myself the first generation to live with prepared-hosts
'Viceroy Countess Miss of the Prime Circle 

'If my name doesn't get you out of a pinch
'At some future point when your life is on the line
~then-imma-whores-wet-nurse
_

They kept to the sidewalks with the most shade & least people
Day burned all pink

Gusts drowned out her voice
Perked-of-interest they walked close together
Miss's voice did not carry

'Jewels owes us much 

'But she is a foolish girl
'Gets youthful emotions 

'Yes Jewels is foolish
'Myself always busy 
'Patch'n up what she self-inflicts

! WACK
Jewels back-handed Miss

Miss mumbled sorrowfully quiet for a time
! PFT

'Well-I-never-in-my-life
~hmp

After a few blocks Miss regained full-compsure

'Tho 
'I am sympathtic 

'To her need to be kept
'From our modular fashions

'Inner-circle ordered her to be pieced
'Into a more sensibly-modified-being

'Operation for this morn 

'Jewels is held by us as a priestess
'Name annointed Jewels by the Seer 
'Who fated her to rise above the most high

'Freckles on her body
'Necessary variables to the deep-cosmic-mathematics

'Trick of it still left to be discovered
'Imprecise how it could settle theorems

'Yet all are certain the variables of the transient-positions of the freckles
'Map coordinates to a universe

'Universe favored to the extreme of quantum-possibilites
'Aligned towards everlasting-happiness

'All lost by Dagon to be remade after the image of their best-self

Jordan braved

'best is relative

What he feared hit him with a twang that sang
Miss even more please detracted the rod into a cane

'Order will seek her out because she is this map 
'This skin even-as-leather will leads us to the universe 

'Freckled-patterns can not be captured 
'The freckles shift & move
'A transient location

She sang a verse

'Eden a rebirth fate
'Quantum Entanglement will require all necessary
'Loved-ones, ancestors, decendants to appear in that garden

Ben braved

'Why work to keep Jewels out of the order

Miss expected such smart over-simplifications

'Fate will bear all to path

'That is my faith 

'Faith impossible for youth to comprehend

Todd defended

'I have faith

Miss chuckled

'Innocence of youth
'Faith is a seed nurtured by decades

'Now shut-the-fk-up

Miss continued her story

'Only by the boon of Dagon
'After this world is consumed 

'Deep-cosmic-mathematics
'Can then be fulfilled thru what functions are impossible now

'Jewels future has such consequence
'If her skin lost to the Order
'It would mean the end of this most-unique possibility

'Which some reveer rightly as a command from god

'Power currents have drawn Jewels
'First to wealth, then to the Order

'Now away from the Order

'Many rather wanted to guard leather
'Than this girl who has such free will

Jewels ginger hair caught the beams of sun
A royal beauty no patchwork could mar
Men cat-called out to her & women envy

Miss continued after they crossed the street

'Only one of our Entangeled-Possibilities needs to reach that destination
'Fate the power which will drag all divergencies to realign perfect-trajectory

'To trust in the power of Fate
'Future to have power to change the past

'The sacrifice of all
'As payment for all to attain
'A more perfect existence

'Our order alone
'Decides for all 
'In solemn manners

Commerical zones now faded to residential streets
Schools, graveyards & empty-lots

Miss stayed herself a while 
Jewels needed to regain strength
Not easy for Miss to talk while Jewels walked 

'The Esoteric Order of Dagon 
'Dates to mankinds earliest history 
'Trends have taken its symbolism to idolitary 

'Fools will be pretensious 

'The Image of Dagon
'Alone necessary 
'To wield unobstructed power 

'Molecules bow to will
'Exerted in presence of an Image

'I myself am a prophetess ordained by the Seer
'The Seer secretly entitled me
'Follow paths by accordance to Jewels

'But the force of the whole-cult 
'Too much to stop

'Someone so imporant must be improved as insurance
'Every day new demands which I alone could not save her

'Jordan woke us that morn 

'Providence gathered all 
'To rescue us out of an unbreachable-system 

'Knights & heroes pale to the deeds 
'Which you have yesterday fulfilled

'It only at the cost
'Of only half a tongue

Miss proclaimed as if it a blessing
Miss odd company to have 

Only thing pleasant
On the long stretch to Todd's house

Sun hot in the hours after noon
Lights on in Todd's house

Todd burst inside heart-in-throat
Eyes readjusting to the different-light

The smell of outside inside the house 

Glass of broken windows shattered under his shoes
Leaves whipped-up under family-portraits

Forms of countless-cats at once made out infesting every shadow

First one then countless embattled-cat-hisses 
Felines sprang into launched-agression

A large Calaco immediately charged Todd 
Heft of it large-muscles-buldging-tense

Todd had two-smarts-on it with a kick & a snatch

Each of his siblings had owned a cat
He pwned these mangey-cunts

10 cats stopped the attack
None of them cared to risk the same demise of their leader

Act duplicated over & over 
Calaco a goolike-mash-upon-the-walls

Fresh pulp of meat arose any kitty salivate
So exquistely-rare the patee 

Despite quelled-up with great fear of the rampage 
Several stopped for a quick-lick

Felines swarmed over something on the maternal bed
Most of the body chewed up but it his mother

Todd began vomiting in the habitual direction of the restroom

Huched-face-first-ass-out across the toilet
Past-prime-pickings now only a gluttonous-feed mass of his father

Todd cleared out his home
Macabre painted in stern-rigtheousness 

Corpses of his parents foamed out of each mutilated orafice
Grey puss foamed over the lines of each scratch

No cat-claw could pierce Todd's thick wool-gloves
_

Neighbors came out to witness the loathesome scene
Guilty & in fear of the boy they all betrayed

None with courage to venture near 
After witnessing the horrendous death of the twins

Two basketball-players on the way home decided to aid the shrieks
They returned to the streets puss-filled choked-dead mid-crawl

Police came to get the bodies off the streets but did not interfere further
_

After the last of the cats, past tears 
Todd left the house bathed in warm guts 

Todd used his might to bust the belly
Legs-to-legs above his head 

Cats in lunacy avoided the same fate
Busy in actions which often condemned them in irony

Thick wool golves perfect for pussy-busting
Raw flesh able to breathe
Yet protected from all-else
_

Cats have 9 lives
But they are their own-worst-enemy

Cats take too long to do anything 
Contemplating calculated actions aun to their demise

10s of bodies litered the rooms 

Jules could not walk fast in sandals
Jordan & Ben decided to give Todd space 

Near 100 disembowled-bodies trailed Todd's direction

Over short distance the cat is quick
Over long distance mankind reigns supreme

Aun to naps the cats put-off-guard 
Awoken too late by the scent of gore dripping off Todd 

Over-fence, thru-yard, along-country-road, over-cemeteries, thru-fields
Until finally rocky bays of ocean 

Rock-to-rock in hops 
Crashing waves below

Cats moved with agility 
But Todd still much faster

Todd climbed up birthed in gore 
Only one entry into a thicket-walled-island

Twisted narrow-tunnel opened up to a vast expanse 

Antiquated farm-equipment
Animals of a rare variety
Fire-pits with altars 

One solitary hut built large as a warehouse 
Loomed in the center

Tatched roof to sustain hurricane winds
Edifice had a lifted concrete-foundation

A large bonfire-pit in the center of the circular lot 

Cat with the first warning-message only-just-returned
As if only to introduce the Reaper 

Todd entered the presence of the Witch 
A mess of steaming-mass
Eyes aflame into a well-set-red-core of vengance 

Crafty & full-of-guile is an old witch
Yet the unexpected blaze of youthful blue-flame froze her dead-heart

Slow is man to be slain bare-handed
_

When the four finally reached dunes
Cats kept clear of the area
Laid outside the thicket in a counless ring
Too-tired from their massive trip to move

Todd off to himself content to a corner 
_

Jewels stomached her way around the witch's hut
Parts of the witch so-scattered-such she prayed it due-to-hungry cats 

Leatherbound tomes laid upon altars under balconys
Each balcony with a bonfire-pit
Great iron-pike stood to hook a cauldron
_

City out for them
No where to go but here

Supply of the Witch enough to last years

Water piped from a resivoir the size of a pond 
Kept lifted & covered
Fed by passing torrents

Firewood came pentiful off ocean drifts
Three weeks went by with even less words between them

Each kept alone to their own interests 
Each front a different fire-pit of countless
_

Jewels absorbed herself learning the ways of the Witch
Ordained now to life's calling

Weeks in the study of the tomes
Prolonged-deduction of the state of each pit

Symbols, parts & bowls, mixtures & brews

Miss created a sheild-like-tome bound by iron 
Four-tomes, two-wide two-tall

Leather-pages made from the thin flesh of the abundant dead cats
_

Jordan spent the time in exploration 

Situation of the island excellent
Built from foundation to be off-the-grid
Preserving certain utilities better than County

Island isolated masked to a scene of like-islands on the coast
Each un-traversable thickets  except for small bays

A worn rock cliff dropped off to mellow-deep-ocean-waters 
One leap exfoliated skin in deep-cleanse

Sea life plentiful & transient
Jordan now satifisfied his ultimate-desire
Self-sustenance upon fresh meat killed by his own hand
_

Ben & Todd in similar circumstance
Understood each other as entirely divergent based upon their reactions

A global power now aimed to get them at any cost
Cat-assassins of wiccan conjury
Ben's dad murdered in an unknown way

The price they had paid for their decisions heavy
_

Miss sung at night

'Song of every bay 
'Existence in seasons

'Day after day

'Today is only
'Just another day

Todd & Ben both well-healed in time
In the careful-ways of slow-healing

Ben powered his laptop at the solar-power-station

Todd kept day-long meditations, prayer, & exercise

Jordan lived in peace as if finally repaid from turbid years 

Jewels shielded with an enshrined Tome

Miss ever diligent to guide & grow Jewels talents into abilities

Driscol permenantly-closed
Five pieced together fact from hear-say around town

5 girls went missing 

One girl rumored to have shit in the same restroom
Shit so terrible the janitors refused to clean it

Other girls all over the age of menstration

An outbreak at the hospital cost the lives of dozens of patients
Rumors of fish monsters 

Consequence of unintentional disaster laid upon Todd heavy
He had tracked the blood he thought was rust & the blood of the elevator cord

Trace that led to the deaths of many innocents

Past month chaos in the city
Under worldwide spotlight & slander 
_

Jewels & the cats kept to each other fondly
Cats avoided Todd at eyesight

Reveering Todd with gifts only as he slept

Dead rats, fish, crabs
& Plenty of money & chains

Todd took to a massive religious-piece
All made in gold large-enough-to-wield
Heft of it a precious-relic

Feline robbers stashed funds daily
Payment for fresh fish Jordan caught & Jewels prepared
All after the manner of the Witch

Jewels learnt all their names
& Kept a ledger for their transactions
_

Lengthy-trip to the city took half a day

Store a feast paid for by the cats 
They stuffed their packs with supplies 

Sacks of food tied to their packs
chocolate twinkies bread peanut-butter cheeses dried-meats pasta
_

Baytowns pull in lost-loiters world-wide

Each soul on drift with the tide
Drawn to far-away spheres

Downtown library sat on the hill 
Homeless hobos just below

Library kept an overgrown field to the back 
Lot left alone as a wild thicket

No-homeless succeeded in making any part of the thicket habitable 
Vegetation a fresh-density even fire could not conquer

Unknown to the city the lot had open-access to city water via an exposed water-line
A river of water from a pipe flowed thru it & continued to town

Fuel a limitless-supply in a limited-area 
Location dense & impassible
_

In a tucked-corner-side-tree
Jordan entered the shadows of the tickets

He lifted a bush-arm to reveal a small path 
He stopped to turn & look at them

Jordan's characteristic move meant something serious

'I really feel sorry for you
'Trust me
'I do

'But keep the bitching down
'There are hobos all around

Crawling, packs-first thru a maze 45 minutes 
Trail looked to be made by a rabbit

Walls too narrow for an adult
Most movements snagged in unseeable ways

Relentlessness if tried true rewarded a scathed-body to an open scene of civility
Canopy overhead a ceiling to bar any beam of light
All bright lit by lampposts which borderd a grassy pathway which led to a small-building
_

All bled

Jordan said to their bewilderment
'I put those thorns in myself

!!! WHAT

~alright-fk-off

'I was much 
'Much bloodier
'Each scaring day
'Than you are now

'Took me 
'All winter & five jackets

'But look at it
~hella-fortress 
'In the middle of Downtown

!daymn

'Love being forced to make the path

'A way too terrible for anyone else
'But the person who knows the end

No one in the mood to buy into-that-reasoning
_

Dim-lights lit the completely-enclosed concrete-path 
Miss admired-always for her cheery-perspectives

Miss pointed her shaft at a metal line

'Above look 
'Foundation of this canopy

'These heavy cords
'Attached to the posts

'All set for the damned Carnival-DesMondes

'If there weren't such 
'Death to the tale I'd call it a-hoot-ta-boot

'Arrogant-migrant-workers disrespected the tropical-storm
'City warned them 

~tsk-tsk

!hmph

'Only-just set-up-just-drunk 
'When the storm struck 

'From different-lands is different-fish 
'As we say

'Torments built into a hurricane 

'Hurricane rearraged this area  
'These cords the only thing left of DesMondes
'No worker nor machinery left afterwards
_

A concrete-path bordered by vegitation & light posts led to a utility shed 

Power & water & network

'Fort Thickets
An intricatly-carved-log branded the lot

Miss continued

'This place forgotten the years which followed Huricane Karma
'I remember having walked by it 

'How years hide their gems

'Two-years after Karma
'Only Univeristy Hospital kept open 

'That is why University Hospital has unparalleled off-the-grid-independence
'It is the host of the entire-regions-network

Ben jolted

'The entire region 
'Networked to the same place

All Ben's route-tracers returned bogus-information which kept me uncertain of certainties
This piece instantly set what he knew right & now he pondered the whole

Jordan explained
Bringing the focus back

'My grandpa worked here 

'On a research-project on our ancestors
'Several photos of my grampa
'Taken a different parts of this place 
'At the time the grass up to the street

'I spoke to a librarian about the place

Jordan pointed to a framed paper on the wall

'Ganked it from the Library

Old schematic the original building plan for the utility shed

'Hardly stealing if its doing the paper a favor
'Better placed framed for me than forgotten forever by a city
_

All took comfort in the utilities & 6 impenetrable walls
The makeshift shower a hose & drain walled off by a tarp

Welcome after the rural lifestyle of salt-water baths
All together in the only room only missing the comfort of fire

Jordan rationed the supplies 
Passage of life ever on serious decisions

Levity & carefree actions never native to Jordan nor Jewels
Now lost entirely to Todd & Ben

Jordan last to sit in the circle

'One night past-midnight
'Stuck on this side of town

'Crackhead-muthrfkrs 
'Everywhere tween here & Industrial

'Cold-front storm hit unexpected
'Rain soaked everywhere without six walls

'Security guard saw me 
'Loitering and maybe crying 

'He called me inside
'Let me stay until his shift ended at 6am

'I ate half of his lunch 
'So cold I drank an entire pot of coffee
'Never could stomach the taste before

'Man I wanted to bathe in the sink so bad
'But that would have freaked-out the guy

Jordan looked to the others
In confirmation the action non-conventional 

'Coffee kept me in good-spirits 
'Snuck out with the building-plan

'I used pure force 
'Couldn't stop the pursuit until I arrived
'Literally

'Rain didn't breach the canopy 
'As long as I tunneled I kept warm

'Rabbits kept the path distinguishable
'Much easier to get thru back-then

'I had to brute-force some parts
'Hell quarter-mile crawling
'Switch-backs & shit 

'Impossible without the schematic 

'I knew the shed still there 
'If only four-posts & a ceiling

'But as you can see it kept good-condition 
'I did some trimming but the lamposts & sidewalk-path kept neat naturally
_

Cabin Fever a bite of polar difference
Four rested on japanese-tatami-cardbord

Electricity filled their time 
Carefree life begs obsession

Ben took a trip with Jules to return with the computer
This place more stable for electronics

Code now set as everpresent network accessible from any computer in the city

Ben enlightened by the occult fundamentals of how the regions network established
Over-time able to find the patterns in the gateways of packet-traffic 

Direct links to network allowed him to forge packet addresses to any endpoint
A large amount of traffic passed thru the Library as bridge to the inner-city
_

Ben hustled on an underground network he help enhance
Able to secure deals-around-town
Rides, chores & groceries

Delievery dropped loot at specific places where rewarded with a map to payment

Deal today consisted of transistors, pop-tars, Mtn-Dew ...
Well-tipped driver offered to throw in an 1/8 of shrooms & marijuana

Ben mistook the slang & accepted 

Ben sent him the location of the payment
'$100 taped at the bottom of a bench at the Selena memorial

Jordan oathed them all to wait for an hour in the bush before entering
One of various imutable-oathsworn-protocols none dared breach

Feline theives financed Ben's assortment of computers
Stable pillars the foundation of a p2p network
 
Constant whir-of-activity greeted him as he opened the door arms-full-of-supplies

Jordan immediately popped up surprised 

~dayyymn-dat-danky
!what-choo-got-der

Bored cabin fever drove them all to sift hungrily at the supplies
Despite an inexhaustive trove of funds, supplies always difficult had

Miss said overlooking the rummage 

'Jewels will like those

Rod perusing thru the items
Flinging items here & there

Ben snaped angrily

'Watch it Miss

Named used as curse matching the tone of bitch
Miss gave it to him & they both went at it

Jewels inspected the bag of shrooms lost curiously 
Branches of marijuana & shrooms on her wooden-bench

Jewels irate she didn't have a new tongue

Miss replied tartly

'Tongues don't just grow-for-the-pickings
'Where am I to get a suitable source & workstation

'A local hobo
'I dont want herpes 
'I get it every-time

Cats everywhere except around Todd
They had their own, quicker, narrower paths to the shed

Jules exchanged with each of the cats 
Pimping new cats nightly each arriving with offerings

Her gifts of friendship
Mixtures of feline perfume 
Jewelry & cat apparel

Cakes to fill with energy
For sex, strength, intelligence
Or skull-fkd-delight

Once-decimated-ranks rapidly grew & grew
Witch focused on control of the cats via orders
Jewels expanded on it with ways to grow mutual interaction
_

Blood is thick with identity
Composition stirred by emotion

Blood magic draws from deep-cosmic-wells 
From which all mankind united as brother

Brew of shrooms & blood-dreched-mint leaves
Miss worked the mix into a pact of blood

Split in unbroken-chants
Chants of each all in circle in turn
Gratitude Respect Admiration Forgiveness

Trance-State-Jewels painted an intricate DIAGRAM
Great symbol encompassed each individual into the whole

'May the blood split
'Bind us five more tightly
'For affinity each to other
'Bond one to another 
'Enriched by bonds of another to another

Legs out connected formed a star
Cauldron laid center-circle boiled over gas stove 

Faggot of rolled marijuana & herbal mixtures
Prepared by the inexpicable mastery of Jewels

Vapor of boiled shrooms
Thick-earthy smoke filled the room

Miss lead their prayer, ended in handsigns
Hot brew now cooled able to indigest

Hours-upons-hours
Moon till noon
 
Movements all-surfing-the-same-wave
In-tune at different positions of the swell

Agony of discomfort
Powered the motion as fuse to weld all as one

Each looked across other in reknewed understanding
Familiar whispers assured strengthened bonds 
_

After the hours of fasting 
Cleansed-via-vomit

They took their always-packed-packs & left Downtown
Long trek thru the rabbit-tunnel passed forgotten

Instead of the left turn towards the Dunes
Jewels lead towards her old school Uptown

Miss began her story
Sure of Jewels purpose

'This school is the one of the famous Duties
'Boot-stomping-bruiser-dikes

After a quick look around at blank faces
Unsure if it drugs or ignorance elaborated

'I am sure you have heard of them
'Movie of them still is famous

~Bristly As English-Boars

'Assigned to troll at Ray High 
'The two marched around so loud
'Impossible to take them seriously

'I knew the two personaly
'Eager to use the material of our encounters
'As material of jest to lead my social groups into laughter
'Which karma hit me back as I proved long-the-fool which is yet to be forgotten

'After decades passed the women finally put to the test
'An abductor, of no small size, took a girl 
'She screamed & screamed over his shoulder 
'Jughead sure in his strength as stoopid

Ben interrupted

'Yeah I've seen the end 
'Faces of Death covers the last-leathal-10-min-of-the-brawl

'I thought one of the sisters died

Miss hooted 
'Disfigured but then again who can tell
'The Twins never were pretty

'Man got it ugly
'Jughead all mush after the elder-sis curb-stomped-his-jaw
'Mashed his brains out his mouth

In the shade of large buildings
School now came into view down the street

'Corpus held the record for highest kidnaps in the world
'For centuries

'Since that incident the city never held a place at even the national list

All now infront of the entrance to the school

'Old age has its toll
'3:30 - 3:45

'Neither can keep their eyes open
'Lure of sweet rest into blissful wakefulness

'We have five minutes 
'Be quick

'If you see two woman coming at you
'Drop the bikes & run

Three boys blindsided in paniced-confusion

! WHAT

Miss irritated shot under her breath

'We came here to steal bikes
'I didn't have time to explain
'But a warning is all you need

'Pick one fast & quiet
'Or risk a face-stomp

They dove thru the entrance 
Snuck under the booth 
On-que slept the two

Every action worrisome for them 
Jewels stitched & with unseeming passager

City authorities on the alert 
This venture had to pull off smooth

Stressed persperation bloomed from their palms
_

Lot of bikes open for choosing  
Unchained due to confidence in the Duties
Whom knew the owner of each bike

A selection unparalleled by any shop
big small large neon pimp rusty caged

Several bikes front on gold-painted rack
All other bikes allowed respectful space

Jules immediately lifted the foremost-bike on her off-shoulder 
She held the pedal with her hand

Miss chripped

'We are ready 
'Hurry hurry rats

Her bike a tricked-to-shit-bmx 

Todd took a practical road-bike after a measurement-mount
Sturdy after a decade of use

Ben hoisted up a rugged mountain-bike
Its puffy tires had a relentless attitude

Jordan sweating under his load

! are-you-shitting 
Four burst in unison

Pimped-out bike ostentacious

Present no place to debate
They swiftly headed out

Following Jewel's hand motions
Silent directions to keep the bikes from making noise

Unobstructed back out on the streets within 5 minutes

After the corner turn they shouted & hooted
High-speed down-hill top-speed

Four bikes bullied lanes
Blasting out onto the coastline

Jordan on a lowrider bike 
All set in chrome
Pimped-with-gadgets-lights 
Kicked-back-position drew his left lip in cool-smirk
His pack bound to top of the front tire to balance load

Finally off the high from the brew back rested bayside 
Front bonfire under night-sky at the Dunes
_

Able to act free
All attention to the moment

Each lost & gained much worth longlasting-contemplation 

Lonely states allow the soul susceptible to higher states of being
Re-enforced by need to rebuild rubble of demolished states of being

Jewels never kept from work 
From creation of brews, mixutures, herb-dehydration

Made by hands of craftsmen of dual-minded-expertise
_

All stared at Todd's replication of the DIAGRAM Jewels had drawn

Jewels then replicated it on a virgin part of the dunes at South-Moon
Large stones laid as the outline

DIAGRAM singular in fashion 

Magnetic bonds pulled all tangibly to sit in their placements
Sand shifted to form acute angles in manners to defy science

Miss began

'All are connected by quantum-entanglements
'Kindred spirits which inhabit spheres impossibly-far

'Bond a constant proof of infinity 
'Distance of null impact in quantum functions

'Bonds drawn deeper in interactions of dreams 
'Experiencing lives of others as Passangers

Cloud unblocked the sliver of waning-moon
Air oft-splashed with water-particles sent high by waves

'Dagon

'Echo of AEons       
'Might & truth

'Nations seek to call him forth as a gateway to divine gifts
'Tho all their world stripped upon his arrival

'Distance which seperates the cosmos unfathomable

'Quantum properties testify 
'All realities
'That can pass will pass

'When one given choice possibility-nexi created
'More divergent the possibility the stronger its core

'One creates universes layered over the past
'& Recalculated destiny thru products of action

'Possibility-Severance
'Occurs when two-liknesses diverge to irrevocable-paths
_

'Distance tween cosmos is unbreachable 
'Aun for the Holy Dagon

'Contact thru human spirit consortium a loop-hole exploited to sumon Dagon

'Multitudes empower other a robust network
'Enacted together in massive movements 
'Entangle a reality thru hacks developed over aeons
'More powerful than Magnet, Gravity, or Love

'Entice Schrodinger's Cat to pull Dagon thru 
'In need to satisfy cleanliness of certain warped-entanglements 

'Ancient traditions passed down thru ages of civilizations 
'Led the Order to confirm evidence found on an ancient-asteroid
_

'A rite to directly communicate across realities
'Experience to be shared across universes 
'Cleared of the fog of sleep into alertness of clarity

'This DIAGRAM given to us as a public gate 
'Our private understanding & connection with the symbols 
'A key to illustrate authentic intention 
_

'A ward of protection from dagerous-minds set to lure into traps 
'Possibilities prove
'Always more wise & powerful versions of ourself
'They who know us as we truly are in objective perspective
_

'Each is their own-worst-enemy
'Each in an Order of Ourself

'Symbols associated daily 
'With their emotional attachment
'These are the armor of the soul

'Five of us strong together
'Each as corner for other

'Our rite will be in the position we assumed during the shroom-brew
'We will bind our hands & legs in sleep during these rites 

'By purchase of comfort
'We attain a way to project to other realities
'Casting our mututal connection there in that sphere

'Able to learn on a scale of infinity 
'Which will all confirm singularity in a situation

Position tho uncomfortable laid-natural
Only a nudge dropped them down full-swing

All woke each in a different quantum reality

000000 TODD   000000000000000

All the world under a dome of earth 

Illuminesent-roots dangled dripping light from the roof 
Plants glistened in shining marvels layered soiled-ground
Each uniquely-florescent in mathematical-patterns

A boy swung a giant sword which passed thru all uncontested
Plants burst a cool mushy tastfulness of sticky-goo
Todd sure it an intoxicant

Each bite gorgeous 
Yet none allowed any sense of nutritional fulfillment

Movement hurried but anchored in a pace of endurance  
A steady stubborness carried a hopeless-heart
Defeated yet unable to change course

He stopped to make hand-signs & speak

'My dog

'I need to find my dog
'Voice is passed to you

In any dream prior Todd could never distinguish himself
Now a clear-headed distinction of the presence of two

Boy made an impatient-questioning-gesture
Jordan came to mind

'Dogs
'Dogs logically gravitate 
'Towards high corners in a dome
'Like the one ahead of this gorge

Todd spoke but the words of Jordan

'Echoes will seem to originate from each large-corner 
'Corners will draw the dog naturally 
'Each path you make will leave a trace 

'Your hack-n-slash tunnel will be a simple trail for a dog
'Your scent is carried in all this goo that drips off you

'More corners you check
'More opportunites for the dog
'To come across & catch your scent

Unexpected to a sudden bloom of hope
Joy burst in the boy from the epiphany

As a laugh in a quiet-room
Todd severed from the spurt 

Todd lurched up-ward still-cuffed

000000 BEN    000000000000000

Darkness 
Darkness but a candle

Turnt towards black-walls of glass
Partitioned by of different colors of ASCII text scrolling down 

Hands worked fast over many keyboards 

Keyboards laid all over on massive workbenchs facing the wall
candles memorabilia research-papers code books tea-set 

Lurching around in rolls
Man wheeled him-self about
Automatic-habitual-paths worn into wood floors

clickity clack clak 

Colorful code displayed on various terminals
Each reviewed over & over

Ben could follow and understand some logic
Tho alien-syntax all machine interaction only 1s & 0s

Characters poured down the wall as waterfall  
Each to fill him with satisfaction never-so-deep

Man merely scan or rapid-fire commands
Then immediately push-on to the next station  
Searching for anomolies or confirmation of work done

Ben digested the code & commented passively
Man gave no immediate signs of listening
But at times a slight pause of typing then steered towards Ben's ideas


Man grabbed a well-used box-vaporizor tube on the bench
Ben recongized the smell of marijuana

'Give me guidance 
'I have gone
'As far as I can 

With a swift habitual movements his hands made signs
Thumb connected to last two-fingers
Second & Third up stiff 

sun-pose => fall => inhale-smoke-rise => hand-sign => lower-exhale

Man took a razor to cut a symbol into the workbench
Stood-up & stepped-back proudly at the panorama

Went to the printer to grab a blank sheet of paper
From groggy to possessed in an artwork revealed Jewel's DIAGRAM

Ben's eye jerked open 
Darkened by Todd's-shadow-siting-up
Fire longsince-burnt-out 

000000 JORDAN 000000000000000

Work 
Every second dragged

New customer
Same complaint

New room 
Same mop

In & out 
Dreary-life

Forced as cog in a inescapable system 

Pentance
Guilty of poverty
child-of-the-state

~Believe in yourself
~You can survive alone

~Take heart & leave this all behind
~Your older brother can go to hell
~For stealing your last paycheck

~Boss here is a one-of-a-kind-muthrfkr
~Use your next paycheck towards

~All will work itself naturally

Jewels radiant
Sunrays sparkled off her light-amber-hair

Her eyes emeralds
Her tongue wet 

Bike hopped 
Rail-to-wall-to-flip

Sparks trailed her as she grinded on a bench

Person shouted partly aroused 
There a deep well of sexual desire

He looked down at roadbike-cleats 
Clicking metalically back to the roadbike

00000000000000000000000000000

All awoke together but all felt the exit natural 

Time null
Dimension past traditional lines of perception

Ben redrew the polygon sign the man etched in the work-bench

'This symbol here 

'I want this tattooed across my knuckles
_

Jewels poked with a sunbleached fish-bone
Steadied-by-her-lack-of-empathy-for-pain

Dipped in root of an herb & ink of octopus 
Peppers & other mixtures to accenuate fine-lines

Symbol beautifully portrayed upon Ben's left-fist
Augmented by the artistic-mastery of Miss 

A simple-but-intricate masterpiece
Black-symbols turnt light-brown-red under the sun

Project became an ordeal which never stopped
Symbols expounded from knuckles up the arm
Amplified by patterns of certain-dreams
_

Night prior fumed-rites into sativa induced sleep 
Saturdays dawns on Dunes after a Friday closing-bonfire

Wakeful morn-tides set calm-stages 
Passive scenes for pre-planned actions 

Night lived combustive to a kindled-scene
_

Todd first-every-morn trained
Habitualizing mind & body

Dr. Yang-Jwing-Ming taught him the fundamentals & forms
These forms into shadow-boxing

Others always helpful to spar against
Jewels an endless ladder to improvement

Each had their own style of agression
Jewels a clever brute force all-in push
Tipped an unwillable scale into land-slide

Jordan only ever defensive, while Ben grappled

Ben now had mastered the counter to Todd's technique with a greater vice
Ironic that time in the girls the only loss

Todd point of redemption of a powerful line of monks

Two hours left his body exhausted but his mind awakened
Forced & pushed as if drift-wood over tidal
Prayers, contemplation, mantras, readings, writing

Prayers coupled by yoga poses & martial forms

Western praktice of sacrifice hardened an Eastern-core

Most decisions in life have no bearing to 
good, evil nor neutral

Philosohy & sciences oriented his decisions
Always to gravitate to a larger reason

Thru the use of constant & everpresent themes
Todd praktised artes of instant-divination

Tho moments entirely new & relational
Distict endgames laid out apparent doors

Doors high-lighted by halos in a sea of the infinite

Todd noted all their dealings in a record which he kept without fail 
Jewels a diamond in all this 
Her emitted refractions captured & treasured fueled all-else

Passangers in Mecca to reach him
Bestow upon him their gratitude
Enriched by this impoverished idol
_

Adventure returned them always to the city
Flock migrations in tune with the season

Spot to spot to spot
All knew spot destinations


Logs maintained if-seperated
Logs pinged their locations
Eventual only all rejoined

Each had a pack of their core items
Each location had accumulated stashes

There had over-whelming amount
Where here never-had-enough-of
_

Miss kept on Jewels to grown her own plants

Power of plant-magik
Unlocked thru engeries of service given to the plant

Sexual-pain in orgasm of the pluck
Never to cut them only guide them with cords

Soil not plentiful at the Dunes
Nor the enviornment kind to plants

Gusts kept all vegitation stunted 
Salt dehydrated all to a hardened bark

Massive acres of Texas farmland surround the city
Miss sure of some region to sneak a garden

A hidden cultivation of plants with access to irrigation

Harvest moon waned to orange/redish tints
Forgotten & unused acres
Obvious against cultivated lands only-weeks past harvest
_

Friday nights alotted for long-suffering-adventures

Jewels had nurtured month-old-plants
Each nested on the bikes

Friday night on a long ride to the outskirts
Farm-hands & all related just-paid-well-drunk at bars

15 kilometers to arrive at the border
Yet there required a scour

These plants would find home or die
Roots could not sustain a return journey

Jordan welded a hitch for a one-wheel-trailer 
Pimped-position kept his feet outstresched ahead
Riding low against minimal air-resistance

Agitation on the plants unavoidabley to scar them with a sense of insecurity
Roots would grip peaceful-plains with a steadfastness from the experience 
An end to which so much sacrifice had paid

/////////////////////////
// Across town & down roads past horizons
// Each passing truck honked
// Calling them out as stranger: noticed & remebered

// Holligans up to no good
// Plants probably drugs
/////////////////////////

Hours passed into moonlight

Jewels finally stopped arms out-streched-skyward
Sensing the energy of a wishful-place

Miss affirmed with air-of-pride
Umprella compass to her magnetic-pulls

'Yes 
'Deep-water in the air

'Jewel
'You dear gem
'Your ability is second-to-none

Jordan keen to practical-ingenuities
Bikes stashed inside an overgrown-roadside-drainage

Jordan always covered them with a dark tarp
He locked the set with his handy-chain

'Bikes will stamp-down trails too obvious

'Without the bikes
'If we move careful
'Passerbys won't distinguish the foot-path

Always it was 5 lenghts in the a sharp turn one-step-path

//////////////
// Jewels carried her pepper-plant
// Strand her variation based on the Witch's main-root
// Heavily grafted with modifications

// Peppers kept off parasites
// Peppers helped keep meat
// Leaves produced thick-smoke
//////////////

10 Acres thru single-file
All infested with dark-red-ticks
 
Mosquitos & gnats feasted 
Bugs bit at their salty-sweaty-bodies frenzied

Lust of meal perked all more for worse

A small hill loomed in the horizon 
Leakage off the hill made the path difficult

Mud caked their shoes till ankles
Shins sliced by serrated-leaves

Jordan pointed at rusted-hinges
A gated hill shut for decades 

Overgrown the gate could only be hurdled

Signs of long-abadonment

An old camp chair next to a rusted-thru-tin-bin 
Decades-old-crushed-beer-cans crunched everywhere

Strewn about odds-that-spoke-of-a-person who kept this place as private-quarters 

Miss commented still worn from the journey

'It must have been a miserable-fool 
'To keep this parcel-of-hell a lounge

Jordan said assured of the hill 

'This is definitely manmade

Tho molds of the hill had longsince-become-organic

'Plains-dirt causes this shit-pit

'No cohesion to let the water run smooth

Pack twisted & curved, blazing up overgrowth

Plants thick & greedy for space
Full of things which crawl & bite
Foliage 10-feet-high at places

Path broke to grassy knoll at its summit 
Plateau larger than what-looked-possible-from-below

A dark plane circle lay flush with the ground 

Miss had a habit of annoying them with her poetry

'A dark portal  
'Sacred pillar

'Reflection without ripples 
'Harvest-moon bore mirrored

Each soaked the sweat & tourtures of raw flesh
Little fish nibbled away the crusts of skin & ticks

Miss explained 

'The architect of th Downtown Memorial
'Once described the difficulty of the process 
'To engineer a water-mirror

~proof-of-mastery

'Where his words

'Here is one formed by more than happen-stance 
'Reflection adapts stabalizing to perfect reflection

Wild grass held a lush Kentucky Green, cool & soft 
Blades of it clung as moistured-gauze
Balm on tired, bit & sun-baked-flesh

Two hours past in preparation of the banks 
Four turned the soil with whatever-worked at hand

Removed grass replanted in care
So beautiful the summit vegetation

Jordan retrieved the still-serviceable barbque-pit 
They alloted a section of the bank for the DIAGRAM constructed with washed-pebbles

Miss conducted rites over metals, wood, mineral
Marijuana dashed over the top
Each hovered over the flames chanting after Miss

Faggots incensed to calm nerves of the roots
Happily-high all enjoyed the moment

rite materials as bed to the roots
Plants carefully enlaid upon pool bank

Dawn broke as all positioned at the DIAGRAM
Taken by sleep upon carpet of Kentucky Green

Japanese doors exposed sections of the outside world
Bright noon-sun shone down a forest pond covered by lily flowers 

A giant python lay in the heat of the day on the bank
Cat neck-stretched top a coil of reptilian

Cat came purring-sweetly perked at the arrivals

Curated-gardens of the same plants Jewels transported to the pond
Soil turnt a rich-dark of ground-coffee-beans & shit

Large wick candle blazed-crackily at center of the room
Tatami floor left a square cement pit for the candle

A thin-metal-couldron boiled hung-over the candle
Metal worked gold into a unicorn among forest animals

Each crossed-legged
Across other around the couldron

Boys in simple alcoyte clothes 

Jordan looked healthy in shocking distinction from nomal-lumpy
Ben was muscular with a thick black beard but a balding-scalp
Todd a plump chinese adorned by the same relic-cross

Chants crept groggy-concious
Mint perked-attention of the passangers 

'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh

Words melded to their minds
Unable to capture the words as one grasps smoke

Jewels eyes burst open
! the arrival

'3 long years to summon 
'Many have come & gone
'But only thee we seek

Jewels spoke in firm-beauty
Perked enticingly by the rich-adoration caused by her voice

Prophet adorned by all-fine-things

A tiara laid by fine workmanship 
Fish-bones & pearls worked into gold

She bowed in introduction
Motioning boys to stand

'I am the Prophet of La Gatenau

'Our monk life paid in sacrifice
'To bless infinite-realms

'In life-mission to seek you five

Jordan passed a cone of marijuana wrapped in dry tabacco-leaves
Puff-puff-pass & handsings in synchronized unity

DIAGRAM & response-DIAGRAM
Set all to ease

Eyes closed & linked forearms
Chants continued


'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh

From darkness grew a purple dot
Slowly the dot grew into an orb

Surface of the planet uniform
Megolithic-dust-storms swirled in simple patterns

Jewels annotated

'A simple devastation
'Earth processed into purple dust

'Image a herald to the doom of your reality
'Doom tied to all in a flood of inevitablities 

'Each Earth in turn nullified 
'To prove the singularity that all serve as  meal to the god DAGON 

'Prepare

'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh

Wakefulness slow
Entrenched in the chant intelligble due to dryness-of-mouth 

Eyes damned by mucus cracked open by tears-of-agony
They drug heavily to the water to soak hours 

Jewels too put-out to set out a healing-vapor
Jordan familiar to miserable situations able to get a tarp laid

All put-out & passed-out on-and-off
Unable to sleep-deep thru present-misery
_

Hunger woke them hours later 
Jewels urged them cautious

Movements in meloncholy for the longing of speech

Instant Jewels woke Miss collapsed of exhaustion
Jewels carefully kneaded her down into her nest

Trance lasted two days & nights
Prophet Jewels dealt them great harm 
To wretch them in suffering-unparallel

~Prepare

A message cost agony
Themselves they experienced as ones-greatest-enemy

Moment Miss woke
Miss creaked out

'Dagon will be summoned
'No force can stop
'a gateway built by
'thousands of years

'great minds of the world failed

'pent-up power so great
'the order can only succeed

With no food forced into a laborsome-journey to Jordan's nearest location

Behind a car-lot near a highway 
Old water & dry food to soothe them back to health

Winter-months at the Library
A bitter-time of sunless-days under a moist frozen canopy 
Passive to the paths of constant-northern-gusts & frozen-colder by the ice off canopy

Jewels communicated by unmistakable gestures
~ fK-this-damn-stub


Jewels argued with Miss in cabin-fever
Miss often only rapt Jewels on the head

Hot but stuffy in a one-room-building
Silent in misery

Jordan spoke up

'Lets go back to the Dunes
'Rather have a few bad days
'Than have all shitty ones

'For-fks-sake

'We all synced to mutual-bowel-clockwork 

'Jewels shits 6am
'Todd always at 7:13
'Ben shits after lunch
'I shit before sleep

Ben snapped back annoyed

'I cant pick up & leave

Keystrokes hammered his mood audible

'Code takes time to set up
'Before I can think of walking away

'We might not come back for a months
'Major pillars of the Undernet based here

Todd pointed out simply & reinforced with suspicion

'We been here over a month

'Aren't you always on about how you can get same access anywhere

Ben got up from the computer tilted
Using his hands to help communicate

'Dude I tell you the same things always
'I am refining mechanics

'But to refine the mechanics in code
'I got to take it apart

'Let me rebuild the modules then we go

Ben had gotten back down to begin typing
After ten minutes passed

'A new drop is coming
'Jewels

He turned toward her
Jewels hissed at him

'Trailer for your bike

Her smile melted all cabin-fever
Happy the rest of her day in merriment

A week required to prep the trailer with all required layers of paint
Mandatory before Jewels attached it to her bike

Todd jealous of the master of Ben to diffuse the situation

'Well we do need 
~coffee-n-shit
'I will get the drop

Jordan's phrase word all adopted 

Ben resumed his clacks

'Wanted: 1/8 shrooms & lb whole-bean-coffee & jelly-beans

Ben threw an accusative finger at the tatami-mats

'Jordan built those for streching
'Yall need to be busy doing that

'You might not know 
'How you are supposed to 
~Prepare

'But as for me I got a damn-good-idea
'My entire life is culminating into the Undernet 

'Mankind is going to battle with some God
'We have no knowledge of how to beat it

'As Todd says 

~I have faith this trajection
~Fit some necessary role in the end

Jordan added to the situation

'None of my skills are new
'Far as me 
~Prepare

'Got it
~smack-on-tack

Todd ashamed agreed to the same
His strength meditation & contemplation

~Prepare

A high-priced-message of no personal-value

Computer-arrays heated the utility-flat
Six monitors mounted on the wall

10 machines of various shapes
Wires of rainbow-sort intertwined them

Ben controlled all via his laptop

Mezmerized as a cold flame

Caffine obnoxiously powerful 
Brew melded into the high
Enlongating life of the trip

6 hours straight Miss convinced them to meditate 
Miss never wrong in these promises

Faggots inhaled & brew passed around
Over large-flame of Jewels hand-made-candle

'just a tttthhhh

All bound to the circle

Skater-krews all over the city skate spot after spot

Jewels tomorrow was going back on the skate-scene
_

Ben took a backseat past weary-exhausted
Drank coffee & blunted-up

Green Bull: coffee & blunted-up

Mechanics of code finnicky & specific
Interfaces must have structural-soundess
Infrastructural network piping industrial-grade

Computer-nodes networked together by homogeneous-unix-kernels
Each tapped into the network on some distributive task

Ben's Undernet launched in desperate soil
A society too long censored

files messages listings 
All projected out in a monolithic P2P cloud 

Regions network-packets only analyzed & routed at central

Unix Undernet easily spoof data-packet in end-to-end end-points
$KEY allowed users, leecher, posts

Each node independent in a lasse-faire
Nodes of most interest had node $KEY of higher value

Ben long-since exhausted 

'Hard to tell when code is mine
'Or not after I type it
'How much credit can I take 

~tsss

Miss stated knitting busily some silk
Speaking around the typically-obnoxious-snores of Jewels

'One enlightens all
'Neural connections associated with understanding
'Natural paths created by mechanical-electrical-piping 
'Quantum Entanglements form all neural-pipingings 

'New connection created an echo out to all entangled 

'To one a connection dormant forever
'To another a deep well of treasure
_

Jordan always went first to break wind
Low to ground with low-wind-resistance

Jewels next along hauled the Tome trailer
A massive chain jingled in a coil aside Tome

Todd next with Ben to follow
Fat tires heavy in a long-haul

Nearby school lots all empty
Skaterless lots on a Friday
Only meant one thing
_

Vacancy meant skaters migrated
Else one or two always be there trick-shit

Ben drenched in sweat & labored approached an old couple walking their dog
Sight of him startled the couple

~hey you seen a bunch of skaters

Old couple only looked back defensively 
Dog in front held in firm protection

Jordan slandered-typically something obscene as they left
_

Eventually it was discovered
Skaters convexed at an all-invited-house-party

Place on the wealthy-side 
A caged tiger roamed the lot

Host took Jewels to present around
Miss asleep in her stomach

Jewels BMX famous since childhood   
Fame a shock to the boys 

Hype of the gathering

'Jewels & the UnderNET kingpin 
?! Are fucking friends ?!

Ben followed Jewels tail 
Sack of USBs passed out

Todd & Jordan both avoided to be the nobody 

Went on their own troll
Hard-core adventurers
rolls, rope, gear

People always talk or prove-up
Most never slept outside a night

Solid-advice from druggies
Weathered in the experiece of horrible situations

'I had to drink water from a toilet
'You use toilet paper to filter

'Did you know you could use toilet-paper as filter
'in a nuke-fallout
_

Masion on the ocean side
Room each unique in its own special-way

Krews from each school present
Ben handed out USB like gold-bars

shots hits motorboats-around-the-house

$KEY of the newest sector accepted as valuable

3am Jewles rounded up Jordan & Todd 
Cleaned up Ben crying-drunk

All trailing their own party of strays
~need-a-place-any-place

Industrial had a window & door ocean-side

Old clothes discarded for different clothes
Blanked & bedded into breakfast

Jordan gave the talk
Each in turn oathed

...blah blah blah
third-party-heresay-result-in-our-death

Four of them left the next day to return with bikes

Krew of 8 could manuever anywhere uncontested

Jordan talked up the Garden
He promised it would be an epic-trip

A large girl named Manda
Two twins named Greg & Steve
Kikochi a Japanese temporary 
_

Kikochi played the flute on Jewels request as they appraoched
Song caught with the breathless sight

A sacred pool in different manners but unmistakable fashions of his heritage

Plants saturated the air in a hum
A great-greenery amassed on the knoll
Polished stones bordered the mirror-pool


Greg asked holding the giant cat

'What does the cat eat while you are gone
'big-ass-bag-of-cat-food
'caz if so you forgot it

Jewels 
~Millions mice in fields
~Many pests feed cat

Cat speaking with Jewels in short-clear-purrs
Walking her thru tended plants of the Garden discussing
_

All soaked in the water
Kikochi struggled to accustomize himself to the fish nibbles

'Creepy

Manda dived under & back up to momentarily obliterate moon's reflection

'Makes me feel more natural
'Two organisms in same enviornment help each-other 
'Not exploiting or molesting

Kikochi pointed to his dick

'What you say

'One earlier bit my penis

Jewels splashed his way 

~Ate tick off dick
~you got favor

Fish food experience too creepy for the twins 
They only euro-bathed

Four felt a calling near
Each in a darkened-dread

Jordan started to lecture

'We are going to be in a state

Greg accepted eager to cut off an unnecessary rant

'Yea we got you guys

'spray your face with water
'dont laugh when you shit-all-over

Jordan blushed, his shit always diahreeah

Miss directed out the large ceremonial-candle-column
Jewels moved it in pain for how long & tedtious the candle took to make

Thin Couldron full of a gallon of herbs & water

Kikochi finished another song
Chi re-aligned-the-mood

0 united 00000000000000000000

Darkness slowly unfolded 
Stillness broke to swirl-motions

Sense of color baby-blue & smell of ocean
Taste of familiar pulls woke them 

Jewels sat top a floating platform
Long sliver hair trailed in currents 

Platform surrounded by mirrors on all sides 
Mirrors enlade by a metal of dark-purple-hue 

Jewels human-upper-form meled to milky-white-scaled-lower-body
False-Dan-Tian Tatooed by DIAGRAM
Below large forest-green-scales transitioned into a pink-scaled-tail

Sunbeams glinted colors off her scales
Her looming over each with her large-orb-eyes slanted-oriental

Perky breasts answered the boys long-since question

Jewels drew in a long-thin-cigar
Fine-dried-leaf & fresh strand
Wrapped in a leaf shell 

'Dagon the dragon
'Coming thru you

Voice cracked unaccustomed to many words
Puffy lips painted a deep-red

'I am Jewels 
'Pearl of Seven Seas

'Aquatic-spirit delves deeper than humanity
'Portion speaks to greater bearths of existence

'You will lose your battle against Dagon
'That impossible to change 

Mermaid-tail waved the water in swishes of calming sounds
Orbs reflected in the mirrors of her eyes

Seven great oculus-pearls rested upon a bed of vegitation
Two pearls cloudy dark

'Be assured
'Many fates await after Arrival

She drew them in with another longated-pull from cigar

'What is learnt of this first encounter 
'Must be transmitted to aid all others 

'Image of Dagon
'A clone entity

'Dagon links an Image in each reality 

'If Dagon killed in one reality
'The god will possess the Image of the previous realm

'Infinity upon infinity in chain-link

'If Image of origination destroyed
'That origination is your reality

'Dagon will be naturally afterwards be sealed-over-time
'Exterminated as possibilities gravitate to the successor

'Lot fated to fail 
'Learn to survive  

All melded as water-drained
Awoke each in front the other
_

Five days had past 

Jewels bowed to the four friends
All kept loyal to duties

~suffering of this time less
~more power for longer time
~more clear the summon

Chili-tea brewed with herbal-leaves
Sustained them quickly to bearable-state
_

Twins rearranged the shed 
All the supplies depleted 

Group managed to produce recipies of what available in the Garden
Jewels & Miss astounded with this discovery able to implement their recipes
_

Symbols now major part of their life
Together set upon a symbol to remeber the moment 
Inscribed on space of body all had vacant

Symbols, flags to awaken sleepy Passangers to alertness 
Anchor to tie-down memory after wake

Mermaid DIAGRAM laden with a crest
Tiara crafted into crest
Crest embroidered in pearl-skirt
_

Morn after long adventure 
Crew under hot sun at the crossroads 

Three boys left back to their homes
Manda stayed grateful to be far from home

Easy coast-hills over dirt bike-trails
Thru some thickets & back to the Dunes

Full moon & initatory dive into ocean
Despite many wails from Manda

Jordan taunted her after she came-back-up

! remember
! undertoes will bring you back 
! eventually

! trick to stay alive that long

Manda responded with hysterics
All had to struggle to rescue her
_

Jewels & Manda took some girl-time
Manda hair too-thick-curly for the sand

They spent long hours molding her dredlocks
Beeswax & oils kept the locks firm

Dreadlocks deeply-cured-hair
Hours endless of labor
_

Jewels

~fk-the-world
~flip-the-bird

Front bonfire in fast of food

Todd lead them

'Our reality will be destroyed
'Others will likely forsee it

'How do we sync to them

Jordan inturrupted

'Streets will always have symbols
'Like grafiti or flags

Miss added 

'Agreed that is wise
'We must each await this

'Symbol of the Gates
'This the Crest of our Pact

Todd added disappointed

'Join up with a movement
'Rather than start our own

'A humble but necessary route

Ben tossed in

'Our mission is to survive

'Ground-zero will be the most logical safe-zone
'Here we set up a gate to enter & strike the Order

Jewels signed

~Eye-of-the-hurricane 
~Or nuke-city
~I say 50/50

Ben continued

'Image must be secure
'Near the portal will need to be a stable
'To them it would be secure one place

Todd joined

'One area to scout
'Pass info to the realms that will be hit

Ben continued

'Presence on the inside 
'Some world power may be found
'This group to enable us

Miss finalized

'Gate way to the heart the Uni

Miss turnt to Todd

'Will that window work twice

Todd smirked cockily

'I had it checked legit

'When I ran away the first time I found the passage
'I snatched the key random 

Ben ended

'Why go thru years of chanting
'To give out a hopeless warning

'All-ever passed-in-this-existence 
'Consumed as meal for one-being-alone

Jordan looked up

'Nests-hella-infest 
'Always centers a fat-bitch-queen 

'We know the school 
~three-god-forsaken-years

'Who over us 
'best to break-in to the Uni

'Todd you still got the window key

All agreed

Jordan lit up excited

Gaze up in the sky arms-outstreched 
Crying out in circles

! Finally 
! Xena 
! in-arms-soon

Each with  creepy-experience
When they learnt that about Jordan

Manda looked around confused

? Xena

Jewels turned her to herself
~stuffed-giant-panda
~used-for-humping 

Ben filled int 
'left in Jordans locker 

Jewels rode the air giving winks at Jordan

Jordan shot out

'Hey dont steal attention from out moment
'Xena is the perfect companion

The invisible bear threw her down to ride her stallion

Jordan smiled

'Hey our kind has pride
'Xena is only inanimate to those 
'Who don't show her love first

'You know kinda like a cat

Jewels stuck confused at the truth
_

Ben frequently rambled-on as he hacked away on puter
Night-times best for dark-terminals & batteries

'Regional network routed thru University Hospital 
'One key likely existed as a backdoor to all traffic 

'Any pattern would betray itself eventually

'Birthday-coincidence-proof is strong
'Cleverness helps quite a bit


Manda opened an adoration

'Ben global 1337 hacker

'Damn-son kill-it yo

Jordan caught it

'ttttahh
'I never say kill-it

Ben continued

'Todd you never asked me 
'Why I was chased the day we all met

All chewed roasted-pepperoni 
Front of a bonfire waves breaking near-by 

'For more than two years now
'Anytime I was at a computer at school

'I waited for a chance to create a listener

'I created code to work-with other nodes I set up
'Set to link together every morning from 1am-4am

'My first major hack was to get all synced
'To try and find a pattern to make sense of network traffick

'Had several functions of ingenuity to help crack it

Manda hooted 

'pimped-out-bitches-like-hotcakes

A long banter flew up & over the audience
Mandy had tried hard to work on her timing

Ben took it back up

'Each node sent data back & forth in search of patterns
'Looking for the known protocol

'Simple mod over data-sets until data parasable 
'When a computation is parsable
'Each node will send to key to a printer I hid in a closet

'I jacked the printer from an insurance office
'They fked over our car insurance

Manda shook her head at him disapproved

Ben defended

'My dad stole cash
'He was pissed I only took a printer

'Snuck it in with my winter-jacket
'Hide in the jacket-closet of Mrs. Stevens 

'Set it up in the janitors closet under the stairs
'Space unused and a nearby net-cable to splice

'I decided to hide at the end of the day
'Stayed in the room with a few bottles to pee-in & snacks

Manda

! OMFG

Ben continued

'Spliced it into the network 
'Went back to sleep in the gym until PE woke me

'My dad flip-ta-bich-&-slappped-me-good 
'Turned out my plan to get away with it flopped miserably

'I got impatient & after a month I got desperate
'I waited till the Monitors 
'All returned after their trolls

'I was right in the middle of the hall
'When they left to go deal with Todd
'Mr. Dumbass walking around

'Instead they found me

Several cracks were made at Todd's expense

Ben drew them back

'My code should have cracked the key
'If its cracked it will be printed
'Just a grab-n-go

'I have the code written down
'I know there are no errors

Todd reacted

'You mean you have faith

Ben didn't take the bait

'Breaking into Uni
'Is most important

Jordan patted Jewels on the shoulder
All always rightly blamed her for their summons

'Maybe we sell ourselves too short
'Who else in the world
'Could crack that type of access 

'Get the data
'Plant an encrypted-bridge

'All seems prophecy to me

Insomnia the soil of Ben's childhood
Night the time Pops popped-caps

Ben always kept actively moving spots
Pops always managed to find him in time 
No matter how drunk 

Popped-a-skull worse the-longer-it-took
Decision to run crossed-a-line 
Trespass forgotten only after the haze-of-next-afternoon

All rant & abuse until then

~cost of new school shoes
~there kicked aside-disrespectfully

~coulda ate McDonalds 

~not the shit-which for lunch
~preparation cost
~the only two free-minutes of the gawddamnday

Ben avoided the clumsy-lunatic easily now
Clumsy-lunatic Pops favorite state-of-being

Once out of sight jump into a nook
He built lights in various places
Tool-set-flashlight in his pocket
Ben used the time to read

Hiding the only time to read
If Ben caught loungeing on couch 
Pops triggered like an explosion 

Once the wild reasoning

'If you didn't mark it
'There no point 
'Have'n to remember it
'Der dipshit

'If no point 
'Of have'n to remember it

'Then why the fuck 
'Would you read it boy

'We elect you
'Mayor Dipshit

Lecture under-pinned by pain
Pressure-points to be taught

'Yea you hate me 
'Well buddy
'All humans hate their daddo
'So fk it

'Lessons need to be learnt
'Dont mean you get em free

shin kick-sweep
locked-hold-grapple
wrist pressure-point

Acts that would be typical of an older brother
If they weren't always too-over-board

Abused by effect of drunk-tryhard-parenting
Ben had heard of worse reasons to be abused

Despite the weaknesses of his father
Ben looked-up to Pops 

Pops cracked to the core
Stuck as single-parent
Provide all in a hard world
_

Pops stole textbooks from the city library

Learnt Ben up on subtle-arts
Tricks too keen for school

Ben would wait in the car out front
Always on rainy days

Pop's favorite artic-military-coat

'Need a reason to stay hooded-up son 
'Two coats to steal-large
'Remember that one

Wisdom imparted in payment for guilt
Of what remained after hazey memories

Gleaming as a redeemed-man does
Passing down a lesson-for-the-ages
Endorphins-high rewarded by evolution

Returned with two large textbooks of random sort
Displayed like hunted-food for a starving-family

Dad always taking Ben as ingrate

'Listen shithead 
'When you get the balls that drop 
'And the skills like mine

'Only then do you deserve choice 
_

Pops a true muthrfkr 
Type to fk around casual 
Leave a virgin stuck with a babe for 2 years

Courageous enough to return to raise him single-handed when needed
A fact Ben used as pillar to keep the image of his father holy
Pops sober-intention understood now after months of contemplation
_

Ben eventually took up the tricks of his father
He accumulated a trove of out-of-date-unix-books 

~To lift up the shell
~To hear the C

Kerigan & Ritchie & Richard-Stevens 
Homogeneous kernel of unix networks
_

Pops once presented Ben a USB
As payment for listening a life-lesson-lecture

'Shit you never know
'When hell gets real

'Cops bust in

~oink ~oink

'They search evidence

'& Where is the USB
'Full of all the evidence?

'Out the puter
'Down your throat
'Before any seent you

Pops showed off the trick with a grin
Ben took it & proved the move

'All incriminating-evidence 
'In your shit at county

Dad down-to-earth genius which he wore too-proudly
_

Each year Pops needed less & less alcohol
To trigger into his habitual state

Reading a sensitive subject to trigger
Ben caught with a book in one of Pops moods

'Learnt is fine & well 

He slurred & slapped 


'But boy tell-you-me 
'no MAn a choose 

'bull-onie-bull-shit
'over real-life-skills

Kick Ben out of the room
Kick the book to the floor

'piss on books
'only fools follow

Laughing maniacally as if front audience
Ben with a mess cleant up quick-the-better

His personal library distorted piss-stained books
Highlights & notes distorted kept him re-writing & marking

//////////////////////////////////////////////
_

Pop phrases always popped back into Ben's mind
'----like fkn cop'
'----like your bitch ma'
'----like ....'
_

Six together around the large pit
Life taken in seriousness requires fast

Ben accidentally interrupting the silence
Then said fk-it-to-continue-rant

'lets see anyone else 

'takeover a whole region's traffic
'fknmuthrfkr

Manda sighed out

'thank-god someone spoke

Jewels gave props

Miss took the rebellion steamed

~Prepare

Manda encouraged by Jewels burst into a rawl of her own laughter
Mood evaporated without trace

'Oh right wit you gurl

'Just me 
'I prefer to 

~Prepare

'On a full stomach

Jordan honored

'fuck-tomorrow
'live for today
_

Food cooled to cold laid in front of bonfire
Each busy in a stationary-task

Hours of silence snowballed energies
Entangled to break an understanding

Stronger & stronger each passing second 
Entanglement-united in deep fight of will over all-else

Ben on a laptop
Jewels caligraphy, wiccan, potion 
Todd pen-set-out write down histories 
Jordan keep the fire & cook & knot

Hana made comments Jordan was the butler
Jordan replied she was promoted to his job

Miss lectured

'Starvation-bonds reach to deep wells of power

'Exploited by the effect of pseudo-starvation

'Hunger in proximity to smells-of-food 
'Will quick-trigger a state of pseudo-starvation
'Any attempt used all power to adquire food

'Hunger empower of Passangers
'If they were wakened of state

'Starved host receptive
'Passanger acute awake-distinct
'More powerful if both starved

'Lessons from the best masters yourself

'Difficult to attribute work to yourself
'Mostly-likely-direct-product of a Passanger

All now ate the cold food in deep gratitude
Somberness an ashe coats pleasures of life

Todd since a child devoted himself to edification
Meditation, supplication & fasts 

Father broke a long-line of religious tradition
All family-notables lived in religious service

Monks with well-written top
Meticulously preserved father after son

Tales of the lives of his lineage inspired him

Grand-father had a dark-side around children
Line forever now tarnished by one individual

Father quit the ministry 
Swore off religion & burnt the bridge 

Lived as pleasant life working 4 10s at the refinery
_

Todd never been to church with family
Father never once talked about grandpa

Todd only ever migrated church to church
To find respectable individuals

Dark cults or enlightened-masses
Each obvious to the beholder
_

Miss once drunk admited respect for Todd's intuition 
400 years put his example unparalleled

Pools of energy bloomed miracles in Todd's dream-state
He led hosts thru questions to fill holes of understanding
Tuned to the others frequency as bridge to pass messages 
_

Todd rants:

'I commit to morals
'Morals only modified 
'After any act itself
'To stand firm the main point

'Monuments of life 
'Done day-to-day

'New-doors opened-for-one 
'Opened to all-who-listen

'Each required to play part in fullest

'Jerk-off, play-tag, school
'All time sacrified
'For few life-long-ideals 

'Mathematical theory worked into notepads
'Pursuitant the reason why question asked

'Kung Fu kinetic logic infrastructure
'Stable actions as well-worn-responses

'Prayers allign mentalities
'Ease a sleepy-passanger into speak

'All morn kungfu wake me into algebraic-groups 

In stero-typical manner of all who do math
Ultimately to spend more time telling others of their hobby
_

Baby-blue-air lit to amber-orange
Deep summer day radiated heat

Full roar of ocean surrounded all

Waves full-bloom crashed
Four in the water

Manda with Jordan behind instructing her


'sync your jumps
'or the waves will crash you against the baracles

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
\\\\\\ Manda ready to return home to face her family
\\\\\\ All in the ocean with Manda tied to shore with rope
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Ben had previously mentioned to Todd

'Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's complete collection
'Pops stole them all one by one over 10 years 

'I also have alot of mathbooks

'They are at a storage-container
'We could haul the lot with our bikes

Jordan jumped down still dripping from last dive
Legs tucked to his odd-shaped-belly
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Jordan dumped his belly-flop

! hella-doe-boys

Long echoe into a crash of water
He swam over to the others

Jordan presented a plan

'We drop Manda off

He spoke to Ben

'On the way head to that stash of books

'Go thru the books
'Book no-one wants 

'slang-dat-shit 
'fat-wads all-day

Ben countered

'Or mad points
'With the library 
_

Hurricane devestated this section of the bay
Homes long-since-abandoned in decay
Reminder to all short-memory-real-estate-buyers & forginers

Five in a pack at night on desolate streets
Neighborhood was dark & villianous 

Certain paths led them best ways

** ** ** (stop)
Jordan looked back

** ** ** (stop)
Jewels flashed lamp-code

Three trucks charged together down the coast below
Headlights thru streets in the fastest route to the group

Jordan hooted in a small call

'shit-gonna-git-real

Section of the city vacant
Decrepit residential neighborhoods soggy 

Jordan put them thru the nearest cut-thru
Three street-blocks crossed diagonal

Juked debris & leaped fences
Jewels tome-busted passages thru several dead-ends 

Back on their bikes 
Rednecks not to be out-witted 

Roar of truck lurched near

Immediately a black mass
Dove into view thru the backyard

Woosh-of-disaster

Truck bouncing on Supper-Dude-Springs
It crashed thru debris front the krew

Hood over the engine a heavily-fortified hull 

Truck drifted-a-j over wet-foliage
Overwhelming in the overgrown yard

!!! HONK 

!!! HONK 
!!! HONK 
!!! HONK 

Dirt & plants blasted over collapsed fence set between them
Till it rained down over the next building

! damn dem der it is

! DATS

! Billys Bike

!!! GIT EM

A hardy-bearded-oldman screeched in wolf-howl
Stumbling-out drunk or dazed-stoopid-from-the-crash

'My late-wife
'Gave thatta my grand-son 

! Billy

Man stumbled out in a riot of cackles
In that empowered way to overcome sadness
Only theeth visble three brown teeth

! yall-gonna-paaaain

Speach allowed the krew time to pass out & thru

Two-other-trucks approached rapidly from other block
Enviornment grumbled in groans-of-the-rowdy-passage
_

Hauled-ass down perpendicular street

Movement as flock 
Jewels in the the lead 

They at times followed her to great pain
Unable to match Jewel's jukes failed into a painful tumble

They curved to circle into second-to-last-house 

Past the block only open grounds to leave them helpless against the stampeed

House, tho soggy, kept a sound-structure 
No-front-door allowed quick-entry

Swift headlights passed moments after

Todd whispered

! up-stairs

Trucks outside in mad charges as bulls
Nosed thru the neighborhoods lurching

Overestimating the stretch carried on
_

Trucks eventually pulled around to circle back

A voice shouted

'Billy keep dat outer-perimiter

'you understand dat sun

Old man illeterated

Ben took it running

'yeahit

Old man shouting to them

'We
'A gonna handle
'All this here

'That there bike
'Cost my dear wife some her life-savings

'& god-damned to yall
'If that helped her heark-attack

Old man called out into a hoot which curled to high pitches

! gaddamn-me
! for what we gonna do to yall

A hoarse, cracked teen voice yeller

'Run-em-down-dead
'As christ on the cross

Howls out windows 

! got my shotty
! pump-yer-ass-wit-salt

!!! ooooohhhhhwwwwwweeee 

!!! YIP

!!! saves-ya-to-feed-as-bacon-to-my-pigs

Five shadows moved as a group house to house
Pumped in riot & bashing deep-inspection 

Effort imperceptiple at such levels of intoxication
Not till umpteenth house the hunt became a labor
A hard & disgusting labor to search abadoned houses
Vomit-inducing sights met them unexpected

A fat man huffed to gather the squad

! you-wit-me
! bobby-go-wit-earl

' We got this house ere 

Hoots of compliance

!Chk er down
!chk ER down
!chk-er-down

Moments later a crash & bash down stairs
A crash at the stairs followed by a curse

! fuckaroo

'damn-fuck-cock-bite-stair
'jimmny-crickets-whore-of-a-mother


! BOBBY 
! EARL

! pull-er-ass-here
! help-me

A voice went outside to call out
Bobby, Earl & the trucks

! dumbass-dipshit-hurt-himself

Four others helped carry
Wounded grey-beard to a truck

Bobby yelled from his truck

! HEY YOUS
! FUCK FUCKAROOS

! DIS HERE TRUCK
! CALL HER


!!! RUMBLE
!!! RUMBLE 
!!! RUMBLE

! DOOOMM
! HAMMMERRRR

Loud-screech lost itself in the maniacal throttle & Heavy Metal on 808s

Truck logo:

~Bobbys Best
~WRECK & CLEANUP

! ole-mother-fucker
! designed to clear this shit
! how-fucking-funny-is-that-boys

' done't earnt
' yerselves proooofesssionales

A shrill accusative yipped 

! THiEVry

Justified the truck took out the corners of the first house 
Down their side of the block

Two on each side of truck linked the chains to the pillars of each house

One worker shouted glove on the right hand
A fith-of-something-cheap in his left hand
Leather-utility-belt hung a laborer-hammer

! I-aINTA-WURKED-DiS-HaPPy-SINCE-VEGAS
_

Pace & efficiency alarmed the group

Jordan trapped in despair

~fuck-oh-fuck

'Gotta keep it real

Todd pointed thru lookout window

'They left the hurt guy in the smaller truck 

'Imma sneak up behind
'Take him down

Todd convinced them

'We only survive if we get a vechicle
'With bikes we lose

Jordan offered

'Take over the truck then reverse here
'We throw the bikes in the bed 

'Skurr-skurr for sure
'You got this Todd
'Ill back you up

Todd declined

'I move better alone
'Just be ready

Todd's tactic relied on surprise
Two meant double-chance to be noticed 

Failure sacrified Todd as distraction 
Chance for others to escape an otherwise sealed-fate

Hand-to-hand combat a dependable solution

Todd left out the kitchen window
To follow bushes along the front

Section after section Todd steathily-crept 
Snail-movements put him under rear-cab driver-window

A locked-driver-door meant his luck ended 
Tonight not their night to die

A solid thrust up the handle locked-halfway

A voice inside rose

'whadda

! whatdafuck 

Todd's heart dropped
Passanger prepared trick 

~Back Bed

Todd luckily placed in good position  to swing himeself onto the back bed

Truck lurched as Todd scrambled upright
Four wheel drive thru rumble of the front bushes

Todd on a bull-of-a-ride
Thrown hard here-&-there

Guy caught-up in manual-transmission with one unusable foot
Old man meant to get to the other truck 

Rednecks always have something in the bed able to break a window
Todd took hold of a metal-rod

Truck-bed jolted left in airborne jump
Truck crashed his shoulder into a tool box

Wheels purchased pavement again
Todd bleeding but no time to tend wounds

Todd immediately obliterated the back window 
Over-swung-rod continued to a red-line across the-head

! yyyyeaaaaoooohhhhhh

Driver experienced to safe-habits saved both their lives
Todd tossed inside among frantic inter-actions of transimission & gas

Todd mid-air hips planted drivers skull into the windshield

'ArGGRreh

Old-man grunted stoopidly
Vehicle stopped dead in a bush

Other truck busy gathering-the-men had caught themself in a mud-pit
Only knew how to rememdy the situation as a pack of trucks

Old-man keen on life
He opened the door & let himself roll safetly to grass

Todd took the truck hard twice

Old-man crackled in shock

! fucking-manual
! motherfucker
! gaddamngears

Todd threw his handsign
Right leg & hand moved independent

Truck lurched reverse & spun right towards his friends
Todd kept 1st gear till the house roaring in RPM

Truck of rednecks first tended to the old man 
Family first over vengance

Attempts to honk at Billy left unanswerd

Todd's body screamed in pain
He stopped outside the house

Flumbling out like-wise the oldman

Ben took the wheel 

Jewels & Jordan hauled Todd into the truck-bed

Miss went work to patch up Todd & set back broken bones 

Jewels massaged Todd's wounds with a balm as he slept
Pepper-balm-sand-clay-scub 

Peppermint prepared leaves to layer afterwards 
All coated by root-oil to encase Todd in herbs
_

Todd patched up & able to rest in the cab of the truck
All grateful to be in-doors

Jordan spoke

'Manda we drop you off
'Can we leave Todd with you

Manda kept unresponsive

Concoction blotted Todd unconciousness
Todd hauled thru Manda's window 
_

Jordan directed Ben

'Lets haul all the books now

Supermart closes in an hour

' Lets do a supply dash
' Unless yall too tired

Jewels

~ nah fk that
~ you dont wanna go
~ you sleep imma eat
_

Ben underestimated the quantity of books Pops stole
Jordan & Jewels left to filter all books into two piles
He first drove to the utility-shed to stash the food
_

Jordan stood outside the glassdoors of the Library

'aye

! tack 
! tack 
! tack

Reluctant guard eventually came to the door

!4am 

!outtahere
!libraryclosed

Same guard from the years back
He turned making his way back to his lounge

Jordan yelled back
! truck in parking-lot packed stolen-book

Guard ignored him too tired to care

An hour & the involvement of the other guard
Required to get the guard back up

'Dude
'Im fucking serious

Jordan assuring him as he opened the door

'hella-books in a truck

Guard unbought

'Yeah & Yeah fk-off dip-shit 
'library closed

Jordan caught back 

'You dont remember me? 

Gaurd now woken complete

'Oh yeah I remember you
'I remember you stole from me
'After I fed you

Guard about to snap

'dick with me today... 

Jordan speechless-from-sadness disarmed the guard
Guard subsided to follow Jordan into the lot

! fuck

A tarp bound the buldged mass of books
Several fell to the pavement as if leaking

Guard jaw-dropped

'Shit-load-of-books

Guard looked back in friendship reknewed
Redeemed from the sharp pains of betrayal

'You just got me promoted 
'Thanks Jordan

Jordan only able to nod & let the guard get busy
Reconciliation a comptemplation to keep him the next hours
Three packed the book & supplies thru the rabbit-path

Walking dark streets at a brisk
Something mechanical in his hands

After quick-glances all-directions at the corner 
He wrapped a bungee-cord around the post

Mechanical-device set on the cord to point towards the street
Lasers set the camera scan of the intersection for traffic

Passing cars triggered a recording-feed-alert via radio
Feed linked to a screen banded to his arm 

6 of them set up
2 minutes of estimated reaction to prepare
In that window of time he was sure of anything 

He crossed the street to verify the device
Arm-Band lit up with his potato-quality-image
_

Warehouse at the docks sat alone in the open expanse of the lot
Waves crashed at the corner of the open lot in heavy sprays

Network scans revealed this location as a common gateway
Weeks to prepare for this night
Coiled ropes & cords flopped outside of his pack

Street front the open-lot he paused to center-chi & handsign

'find the office
'find the gateway 
'hack the gateway

'Run this cable along the gate
'Set it up to the city-utility-connector

He turned & pointed to a green box at the end of the lot 

'New cable will upgrade the connection
'Which I will slightly tax

He went forward in a rush of energy

'Keep tabs on my wrist
'When it lights up be sure 
'Nothing is missed

~show-time-muthrfkrs
~keep-it-real

Late hour kept alerts down

Man approached the fence

'Probed an oceanside-window last-week

'Security checks up a few times a night
'No system to the timing

Along the fence waited two-minutes with no feed

He only needed 20 seconds
Nike-Free soles molded to the fence
He jumped up & over in fluid-silence 

Fences his expertise
Preferred hurdle to set tween chasers 

Movements direct & pre-planned 
Base of the two-story office-building in quick cover

He looked up to the window probed last week
A loory alerted & passed 

Took off his pack & un-latched the rope
One-end clean-bowline achored to a thick-pipe 

Window-ledge hoisted jump to a solid throw
Rope now set for the ascension & rappel

Sensitive the man responded
'GriGri
'Dont know whatcha call it
'Every-possib has em
'Simple physics really

Opened the mechanism to demonstrate the core

'Main point is find it
'These will save your life

Hand ascension set quickly with carribeaners
He set the line with his weight to walk vertical

Quiet-movements swift in a flow
Done in Qui-Gong breathing-techniques

Feed-alert flushed him against the window

He worked open a rusty window with a thin steel piece
Remarkably similiar to Jordan's tho looked decades older

Slipped his body narrowly inside & shut window

'Only leave windows open if there is danger

Musty-warehouse ordor with wiffs of fish-reek
Office-quarters sectioned into cubicles

'You expected fish-smell? 
~weird

Family-portraits & anti-stress-toys on desks

After quick inspection of the floor 
He tested the locked stairwell door

Network lines followed into a locked-closet
Whur of computers inside assured the location of the gateway-box

A pouch removed from off the pack
Only after clumsy effort the door opened

He used two extremely thin-yet-strong rods

Inside with laptop out & on
Ready for the mission

A bogus label on the laptop

-DNS SERVER-
-KEEP ON-

-network will not work if off- 

New cable to connect laptop between gateway-box & ISP box 
A new label placed on the company-gateway

-troubleshoot
-check DNS server on

Gateway-box had a sticker detailing the network of the Internet Serice Provider

Information directly configured into the laptop kernel
No need to get into the gateway-box

Man-In-The-Middle attaches between two point & pretends to each end, itself, the other end 

ISP->MitM->gateway

Ben woke from dream & wrote it down 
A photo on a clerk's desk called out to him

Family around a sign on a sandy beach
~Pilgrims Pennesula
Icon of the characteristic-coastal-bay engraved

He recognized the part of the coast
_

Dunes spring time
Jordan out snorkling with Todd

Tide nice & calm 
Skaters waited their turn on the beach
Mandarins thrown around 

! kingpin

Skaters greeted Ben
Clay Dorsey Javi & Homer

Ben joined them & caught an fruit 
He waited for Jordan & Todd to return
_

Jordan replied to Ben

? Pilgrim's Pennensula

'Never heard of it

Ben drew the shape with his fingers upon wet sand 

'Shape of the engraving
'Put it just south of the Bluff
'Right there

Jordan smirked

'no-shit-murlocks
'Well thats the answer

'Not much of a vacation spot
'In this reality

'I been out there once

'Maps read it to be a NeverLand
'Miles from no where
'Fresh spring water

'I get there eventually 

He paused for their meal
_

Clay didn't know how to place Jordan
Jewels a bmx Legend
Ben the kingpin-hacker
Todd an odd-ball elitist

Jordan normal as any kid
Yet he always spoke to an understanding next-level-astounding

All been up since last night
Water gleamed off round shoulders

Last night they got to boasting
Pull-ups essential for upper-body-strength 

Made a competition out of it
Each to arrive at end & see where each strength settled

Jewels bored after thousands

Pull-ups best eased into over time
Stretch mandatory

Jewels instructed them

~  Grab arms-out-streched over-head
~  Lay-out abdomen 
~  Strech as bow

~  Hold elbows over-head 
~  Lean right & left
_

Pull-ups noticably power their bunny-hops

Leaping over a fence happens hourly at night

Feeder-by-turns
One would anchor his skateboard
Krew one-at-time run get up on the skateboard to be heaved in aided-launch

Up in the air to glide into a landing
Favoring the skateboard in first contact of the roll
Then helmet then pack

Each in turn first to fly
Lauched with skank-out-as-flag

Next up used skank to land & guide the rest
_ 

Jordan continued his story
Hardly a meal fruit-no-meat

~so-yeah
'About the Bluff

'I finally end up there

'hella-before-dusk

'Ready to bail back to the city 

'Found it a perfect place
'Set up camp & nighted deep into it

'Believe-me I could hardly sleep

'This place a Neverland
'Hours scheming new options 
'Infinte places to set-up camp

'Soon as sun went down
'Buzzes filled the air

'Swarm black against black night
'Worst night of life

'Kept all night gripping my bag shut
'Bugs collided into sack all night

Jordan made a tsssss at Ben

'If you go out there
'tssss

'You deserve what you get

Todd felt a draw towards it

'We go tonight

Jordan face-back-attitude 

'Da-fk
? Only to troll

Todd reassured him

'Full moon should keep bugs-down 

Jordan palm-face 
Ben took up the challenge 

'I bet 4 supply trips
'Place a landmark-tourist-attraction

Jordan took it

'Bay took almost a century to clear out
'Logically the Bluff an ideal first-landing

'But with all the hurricanes
'Any place would have cleared out long ago

Well assured any nights suffering 
Worth four free runs

Jordan least busy yet he treasured idleness

'Prob different in this existence

Clay broke in

'Dorsey you in

Dorsey declined

'Nah
'Chill at the beach
'Imma hit up Sabrina 

Clay settled it

? Out far
'You need bikes right
_

Back down to their core 5
Out to the highway 

Dismounted & walking with bikes for the feeder
Hitching a ride southside the oceanside-highway

Over-sized truck pulled over
Eager to make-use-truck-bed

Scratchs & dents 
Marks of reputation in Texas

Man at about 50 wearing a decade-old truckers-hat

'Yall take trip this late
'Not much to do out our way

Jordan replied

'There is a party 
'Southside at the Bluff
'Ben-here gots a date

Jordan nudged-openly at Ben

Call getting the old man's hoot

Travel-moochers must be good company
For-karmas-sake

Old man now jeered

'Throw yall bikes in da back
'Cab big enough
'yall come inside

'Pray someone gets laid tonight
'I aint got no possibility now
'Old-hag divorced me
'Took everything but this-here-truck
'Put this fine-lass in the PreNup

His meaty-hand slaped the dash hard proving-the-rig

Jordan always kept their packs in front when hitching
A good barrier & first-contact-pad if one had to jump-out

Old man cackled-loudly the entire time 

'Any particular place on the bluff?

Ben put in

'HEB 
'we need to get a few things

Oldman parked front-the-store

'Im just around the corner
'If I see yall again 
'I pick ya up

Jordan asked crawling down the truck 

'Can we get you a 6-pack

Oldman's eyes glinted
Hooting into the night

'Moonshine keeps my figure

He didn't get this old 
Letting youngers buy him alcohol
_

Fresh supplies always hard-got
Stores hevanly places of plenty

Jewels gave props to Jordan

~ ace-hitch

Jordan smiled back

'Yeah that geezer legit 

'We can scout a base
'Camp eazy-time-to-spare

'Test out our new mega-net
_

Cashier looked upset by their selection
Obnoxious-in-cost & too-much-to-carry

Bandages behind his ears hid-tattoos
Black long hair sleek hid-the-bandages


'Those bikes yours out front

Cashier jocked at their bags

Ben fished info out of the cashier 

'There is a party here tonight
'Pilgrims Pennesnula

Worker started-up 
Oily thin strands of hair stuck-to-his-startled-expression

He turned & looked side-to-side then to face them

'Kay first
'never mention Order matters here

'Kay idiots

He leant in closer all bro

'Tonight 

~at midnight yall
~is-gonna-be
~HELLA

Clerk sang into a low-whispered-dance

'Just keep on Jalisco
'Straight after the barrier
'Just wait your turn on the train

Deep-folds-of-skin on his neck leaked oily sweat

! it-gonna-be-tittys 

'So wassup girl 
'See-you-tonight

Worker appraised Jewels figure
Muscular legs in stockings & shorts
_

'A-holy-fk-this-wind
Jordan grunted a ways down Jalisco

Main street of the town to terminate here
At a straight-shot back to town 

Ben shouted
Bags anchored in such wind

'Better-than-bugs

Jordan yelled

'Stash sup & bikes

'Find a bush
'Eyeshot to the barrier

He pointed at the road-blocked steel arm
Gate locked off vehicles to the area

Todd chirpped 

'I wonder 
'What possibilities would have been
'Without the hitch

'So many random-events
'Create such drastic trajectories

Jewels faced Todd 

~Or they 
~Drawn to us
_

Sting of sand brought packs-up to protect their faces
A mile & half past barrier end of the pavement

Puddled dirt path led forward 
Each turn more extreme

Tire treads scarred earth in deep imprint
Mud pit after mud pit impossible to most vehicles

Jordan pointed to a hilltop
Lone it loomed over the bay

'Deer paths better
'Than this shit-cake-show

Miss spoke out

'This part of the bay 
'Hit-gold round the 60s
'Karma swept it all away

Gray-clay clung each step 
Streaks smeared along calves

Sanded-wind no longer a blight to them
Wind blocked by the extreme up & downs of the passage

Jordan happy

'No bugs yet this path aint so bad
'Only got to carry a de-shitter-stick

Jordan gave an example
Scraped clay off his shoe in one movement of a stick

Jewels a nervous wreck to keep her Tome clean

Thickets dense yet always with animal-traffic
Trails connected into mazes of paths 

Hilltop visible most times

Miss stopped them with a whistle

! whiirp 
! whiirp

Jewels set her pack down to kneel
She gathered a bush of dense aromatic-herb
Clippers & twine Jewels made four sachets

~rare
~good luck

All wore leather cords to drape sachets 
Flagged them amoung others as distinct

Bags of dried herbs & fortune charms

Todd regained strength

'This place aint so great 
'Even-without Jordans monster bugs

Toke & refreshments 
Then they mounted packs

Up a steep hillside
Thicket trunks as ladder to climb at-times
_

Hilltop suddenly broke-away to panorama

Dark shoreline illuminated under moon
Great waves of the ocean hurled into near-by-beachs
Outcrops of dark boulders in the distance

Jordan lamented & pointed 

'Buildings south-west 
'50 feet inland

'Off the barnacle outcropping

'You can see the straight shadows of the roofs

Ben without doubt only waiting eventuality 

'You should have known better to bet against me ole-boy
'How long you gonna survive
'If you bet against people like me

'Four runs full of computer equipment & the like

They set up camp in the sunset
Stitched-together mosquito-nets

Clouds now-only-parted after sunset
After return with the supply-bags

Jewels danced around serving herself Twinkis
~ feast all now
~ HEB way back

Jordan

'Even the hike not too difficult
'This may have been our most smooth adventure yet

Jewels smacked him back the head

Jordan recoiled sorrowful

'muthrfkr-I-cursed-dam-it

Open hilltop enshrouded by the thickets 
Summit a small barren area eye-shot to beach

Camp set secluded below the sand-worn-platau
Deer trails led only those who knew how to read deer-trails

They left camp to inspect the site

Jordan got them on a straight shot to the beach
Beach walk shoeless to the distant buildings

~Pilgrim Pene... 
A sign half-buried-by-an-accumulating dune to the side

Ben pulled it out

'Exact same logo

Jewels signed at Ben
~trippy

Miss long-since asleep in her belly
Jewels woke her up with a burt

Miss burrowed her way up
Got set up all right
Then rapt Jewels on the head

All buildings degraded from decades of age 
All heavily-boarded as to block all entrance

Ben gave-up 

'To get inside any of these required
'Half the building torn down

! vrooom vroom vrooooooooom
Trucks roared in the distance

Pack followed Ben's dream to the Bluff
Frontier of thickets & road-for-crawlers-only

Hilltop at the Bluff overlooking the beach
Once named Pilgrims Pennesula
Wiped from maps

Crawlers arrived loud & slow
Each trick-to-shit-truck hull connecter to the aft of the forward

Only pulled or one drug
Each to their slow crawl

Drivers comminicated to the whole via lights
Driver communicated to their front-back via radio

Each on swing in a tree top an over-looking hill

Jordan accused Miss

'Why didnt you tell us

Miss look backed ignorant

Jordan called it bullshit

'That building-wood less than 
'the-fk-long-your-centuries

'I know you know I know
'So just so you know
'I know

Miss fluttered her umbrella 

'Hey a bet is a bet
'If you would have backed out

'You would only have lost sooner

'I like to see these things 
'Played out naturally

Jordan unsatisfied but beaten

Miss assured him

'You loser face is so cute Jordan

In turn passing binoculars

Rednecks in merriment of logistics

Barrel-man some type of mix between pagan-pope & local-drunk
seed-far-fallen from German ancestry

Moonshine in an over-sized-wooden-barrel
Wood bound with steel with its steel pour-knob glinted

Calves of man thick as monster
Keg hauled on back or hug out-front

Jordan lost in amazemnt 
Himself couldn't manage those feats even without load

All had cerimonial gauntlet
Eager when their time came

~to be washed 

What looks like they called it from binoculars

Each once cup filled-to-brim 
Take it down all at once-handsigns

Barrel man a certain-type-of-mix
Between pagan-pope & local-drunk

! vroooooooom 
! vroooooooom 

Headlight beams upon low-clouds 

Firewood netted-down on truck-beds
As-if an entire forest to be sacrificed

Each helped haul the other 
A train-of-trucks connected by chains

Each pulled the other along in turn
To unlink at the beach
Dunes set up with a launch run
Sent sacrifices Dagon way

One charged fearless up the runaway and shot off the ramp
Rocks & sand sprayed as it landed then slid in a skilled-stop 

Jay-drifting bed-flap released nets archoring the firewood
Rocketing the loose-fire-wood into an accumulated mountain

Over 100 trucks arrived
Trucks all parked neatly single file

Light flickered in blazed of enormous bonfires
Buildings all operable in service

Booths of live animals
Fortune telling & street-magicians

Merriment wasted on alcohol

One truck hauled a tethered cage
Truck after truck hauled a tethered cage on a rail
Truck jolt off a sacrificed animals into deep-sea

First anchored-chickens then pigs then sheep
Goats were the oddest-acting-creatures when flying
Each looked as if it excepted to one day fly
_

Robesman made rites aroudn the bonfire pillar
A great thin fog froze as monolithic-clouds

Each driver with gas in the gauntlet
Siphoned from their tanks
Tithes to fire-pit 

Party-a-coil around the fueled mountain 
Summons audible on winds

A dark object arose from the sea
Long form drew the LochNess dragon

Large fins stepped to the beach
It approached the erected wood

A flash of strike invisible to the hilltop
Lochness sniped half the body of a man
Which it flung up & crunched down 

In a great roar the dragon stood upon hind legs
Falling into a bellow & flame-lashing-as-whip
Aun hilltop shuddered as the creature landed

LochNess returned to the deep
Bonfire lit up in explosions that lauched several logs

Aquatic-beings arose from the deep 
Some took the wounded invitingly 

Dance drank & mate 
Intoxicated merriment

Dragon retreated into the horizon
LochNess head visible as distant sentinel

Tentacles foamed out at the shallows
Tentacles stretch miles from deep-abyss

Source megolithic past scape-of-view against ocean landscape
_

Auquatic Robesmen in odd-shapes joined those on the beach

Encircled the crowd from ruckous into silence to chants
Odd-aquatic-hums of deep-water

Line hand-bound uncoiled towards the deep
Towards the outcrop of barnacled boulders

Men & Women & Fish-people in odd-orgy 
Foamy-tentacles the medium of sexuality

Tentacle-nipples sucked body in lustful-pleasures
A prescion to expound pleasures hundred-fold

Electric-plup-sacks-soft-yet-firm-jelly
Tingled refined-levels-of-inticement

Tentacles hairy of all types & color
Hair striked as whips to naked flesh

Distant human forms flung up upon cum
Caught and cleansed in waves by god-like-appendages

All unkoothe
_

Green glow lit the horizon
Believed to be illuminesent-algae 

In time it drifted distict & apart
A single small orb drew all in a light
Light more a fog than a billiance 

Impossible detail opened to Todd
Green glow pulsated hungrily

Emerald-green-orb folded into golden scales 
Set top a scepter in fine-ways of master-craftsman
A hermaphadite-god enlaid upon it as crest
_

Monstrosity flailed in the high-winds hours
Tentacles fucked-all-one-to-another as puppets

Man woman tentacle intertwined to monolitic movements
Rolls of flesh in vibrating unity

Foamy-scenes of garganteuam-enviornment
Sex-smell thick in the dense-foggy-air

Ride over all dismounted in a beach-ward swim 
Chain of victims linked by arm walked into water

Unlinked & snapped up by tentacles
Shriest & cries & terror drawn to an end of utter-need

Lust of the tentacles gripped each in deep care
Pulpus forms molding & humped aggressively 
Nipples now hard knobs

Foam spouted out of the orafices
Hotly layering the naked bodys

Great shocks of electricity sparked-arcs tentacle-to-tentacle
Air filled with wails of the deep pleasure of pain

Air now all hot in steam-of-it
Sauna of sexual particles

Orb out-shone full-moon in bright-green-glow 

Each person upon release locked in stasis of electricity
Blue light iluminated the frozen-forms

Each in turn awakened caught in full-bloom-of-lust

A freshness devoured tastily
Mouth crunched & smacked noiseily

5 Students in a library on the second floor
On a balcony overlooking the floor below

Government officals stood attent 
Children presented their impossible-discoveries 
Rings of power set in velvet boxes

Rings tracked-down against all odds
Items of legend to world-wide-press 

Attained by these children
Easily as if rings awaited them

Students honored & proud

Jordan's voice spoke inside

~aint-gonna-git-me-suckah

'muthrfkrs are ganking you

Kid took the hint whole-heartily
Immediately before the boxes collected

In feint manuverd by Jordan
He re-lifted the LOCHNAR ring
As he closed the box-lid

Green-orb reassured his palm with warmth

Officals promptly recited their routine-disclaimer

'You will have no more dealings with these matters
'Any attempt would mean the end of your family-line

'You service to this government will not be forgotten

Military Police saluted then escorted them out briskly

Cast-shattered-faces-of-friends

If not for quick thought himself like-wise
If not for the quick odd-thought & grab

Government all on the upper-floor
A swarm in relish of the spoils

Kid quick out at bottom level
But one of his mates quicker
He ran up

'Hey I saw you
'You didnt give yours

Mate shoved the kid back towards the second-floor

'You will get all our families killed

Undaunted the kid pushed ahead 
Outmatched-mate yelling vengeful

! He took the LOCHNAR
! He took the LOCHNAR

Typically ignored by adults
Drowed in celebrations 

All who knew the call's significance
Too deep in the party to hear
-

LOCHNAR a trusted-friend after months
Kid out submersed in the streets

Rings of Power drifted as winds
Past thru owners as one grasps air

Kid recovered several of the rings

Red-gem called to him in drunken-state
Gem in possession of several thugs

Those thugs now circled the kid's krew
Krew small-looking but elite in strength

'Heard you been asking all around
'about ruby jewlery

Cocky kid provoked back
This would be stealing-from-children

? You got it

Man flashed up into a rage at the bait
Courtyard exploded full of rumble of the rough & tumble

LOCHNAR in the end subdued the thugs

Ruby jewel jumped away under a night-stand
Kid knelt down to retrieve the ruby 

Out came a little spider

'oh sir oh sir
'we serve we serve
'to you to you
'sacrifice sacrifice

Gray of hairs in semblance of royal ancestry
Majestic mane a coat of many grays

'Eight Legs Eight Legs
'Many eyes Many eyes
'All yours All yours

Kid agreed compliance

Spiders after milenium in waiting to rebuild kingdom by the Ruby

00000000000000

Under hot-tarps mid-day till sleep available
Breakfast-dinner & de-camped over a light-fire 

No trace had been left of the night
Gulls cleaning up had an over-sized greatness

Jewels knew that one of the 100 had spotted our bikes
Yet Jordan proved true again 
Tho admittedly the bikes were out-in-the-open

! CAR

Texas flat-lands allowed plenty warning to a car approach at night
Past midnight but sweating in the humid night

Krew dove into a secluded-spot
Aided by the camo attached to their packs

Scotty tandem with his new gir Kitty

Scotty begged that Jewels get him the bike
Then all journey out to the Garden

Jewels figured Scotty easily owed the bike 

~Bye Bye
~Sweet American Pie

Hummed in the faith, tonight the two would lose-virginty
Garden a perfect place Scotty promised Kitty 

Kitty plump-perfect-breasts
Breasts hung heavily yet perky

All under load 

Jewels had the Tome & mixtures
Jordan hauled firewood on trailer
Ben had tarps & supplies,
Todd hauled-all-else using Jewel's trailer

Old one-pump-station marked the midway
Always visted on the trips to stock up

Krew full speed non-stop
Store longsince-shutdown

Familiar smell grumbled Jordan's stomach

Jordan heartless-filled Todds-trailer
Now all thankful for Jordan

Dark-clouds passed-brisk in bay-winds
Bright moon faded in eclispes of clouds 

Contrast empowered Jewels to embue powerful spirits
Hillside her tools laid out on the grass on a work-blanket

Soctty had all in a stir with his sweaty work
Tho impossibly larger above
Hill in such times too small

Moon high when Scotty & Kitty returned
Aura bloomed into the maturity of satisfaction
Ultimate satisfaction of naught-else-higher

Scotty iceberged the titanic-of-awkward
Explained holding Kitty bashfully

'Kitty these are their states 

Scotty counted them down for her

'Brew state gave powerful dreams
'Smoke state to inspire them before journeys
'Balms to calm imflamations of deep meditations
'Edible state purged them before fast

Jordan ventured freely

'Due to the feminine-lure of drugs
'We five are often blitzed in those states

'In fact Todd calls it meditation

Jordan shot at Scotty

'Remember the waffle-maker

Scotty jumped on Jordan to silence him
Now the frozen hillside erupted in shatters

Jewels imediately filled the vacancy next to Kitty

~ Miss go to sleep

Miss startled

'Well now 
'hear me
'...before 
'you give me a bed tiMe...

Jewels stuffed Miss down & into stomach

Awestruck by it Kitty looked-back-up to Jewels
Eyes big of questions & girl-talk

~ tell me
_

Night wore on

Jewels prepared a faggot with Kitty
Embued by the energies of sexuality
	weed, flowers, dried herbs
	weed, driftwood, dried-sea-plant
	honey, leaf, 
All wrapped in a leather-tabacco-cord

Jordan's bonfire which once raged
Now it only a deep-slumber-red-coals

Tea while inhaling faggot
Wind directed their puff-puff

Ben's tarp formed a Tea-Pee
Around the encircled-fire

Hot-box-tee-pee

Vibes resonated the vibrance of spring-night

Kitty blushed to cherry awe 
Enamor Jewels first ever-understanding of the beauty of blood

Kitty in a state-of-being
So long imagined now lived

She took Scotty across the lake again

Cat unabashed to follow & creep from the bushs

All sexuality perked 
Kitty fk-else-fks-loud

Fingers into the balm Jewels snuck her
Spread over her nipples & then her clit

~oh the good ole 
in-out in-out

She sang in a pleasure of pain

Jewels been awaiting it
Burst into a seizsure of laughter

Yet nothing could tarnish a scene of Kitty lustful
_

Jewels out among the plants

Todd chewed a cluster of mint & cane cross-legged 
A comfortable desk kept here to write atop 
Start of the session of night-prayers
First above-all-else give-thanks

Ben over laptop powered 
He mostly first read logs

~logs are the flow of code
~understand the code by observing the flow

'Events of a system
'A cloud where one area affects rest

Pondering ambient ideas from logs

0 TODD 0000000

Mountain-top in snow-caped Asia
Teen on a trail-run up the ridge

Path of it only difficult & narrow
Death only consequence of mis-composure

Night put this path impassable
Aun no place to sit

Slopes all drastic & divergent
Smoothe to prevent retrace on this maze

Ancestors kept this vale sacred
Journey for the boldest-of-heart

Mission to fill two buckets
All the weeks sacred supply
To present to goverment goons

Their villiage enslaved

Teen answered the sentiment

'In this reality 
'Everyone is a slave

'A lone mountain spring
'Drip by drip by drip 
'Once a week spring fills a small pool
'Large enough for these two buckets

Steel rungs on each end of the staff hooked the buckets
Sturdy iron-wood-staff laid in steel & gold

This sacred relic allowed to be non-stripped

'Precious symbol of subjection & servitude
'Aun our mountain god

'But they are fools who know little of us
'Scrolls fortell a hero born from these slopes
'One prophisized to free the people

'He would never fall to the pits of the spring

'I have yet to fall in the pits all these years

Year after years on trails to train him
Paid too good to stop
No other bold enough
Every runner has died without exception

Passage across an art
Technical expertise in a finesse only permited-way

Necessary-outlet out of opressed-existence
Allowed to roam here free

Out here naught could lord him
Out here he king of the world

World as far as eye could see
'As long as you don't look over that slop

Trail ended before breaching ridge
Ridge of dark peaks like great spires

Runner could only stay in this desolate place as King
Until a meal came to mind

If another meal wanted
Necessary to return before night-fall 
_

Todd amazed by the mastery of complex movements

Hip warm-ups the vital key

Low to the ground 
Buckets anchor points

Movements of a kung-fu master
Todd learnt deep paths 

Animal forms applicable to the present obstacle
Camel Mantis Crane Monkey Russian Bear Turtle Mouse Drunk 

Staff balanced on his neck he clasped his palms

Handsigns swiftly-executed 
Dab of precious olive-oil 

'Slavery will not break me
'Here subjucated as all are

'Tho slave 
'I am your master

'Proported powerful-being

'Here with nothing-to-my-own
'Built a marvel to all eyes

'Life in pursuit
'Of this simple mastery

'Tai Chi Qi Gong
'Breathe in
'Keep your center
'Breathe out & move

'Extend or contract
'Breathe in & keep your center

'Staff a double-polar-end 
'Stable four vector anchor

He tightened one hand & pulled with the other
With a whip of the back, the steel ignited against a rock

Once proud boulder chipped-off a good chunk

Todd able to speak

'I am of a tribe of Corpus
'Five of us live as nomads

'A comsic deity known as Dagon
'Will consume all possibility connected

Todd felt the lump down his throat

'We are fated to lose

'We are to learn how to kill his-image 
'Then we have to kill him 

Slave responded

'Always in dealings with fate
'Correct answer always to fight fate

'LOCHNAR has chosen you

'A power which when recieved empower all connected

'Act the night of moons-green-glow
'Fortune to use-opportunity

Todd caught a tight terror
He said nothing of LOCHNAR

Slave continued to fill his buckets

'Time to end the summons
'I never summon & trek

Todd braved out

'I can get you over the ridge

Slave cocked back

'That idea means succed or die all-in-from-the-start
'Passangers always act too rashly

Todd promised

'There is always a trail
'One to the top of the ledge
'Climb 20 meters up the other side
'To apex of the gorge
'You will find a deer trail
'I will lead you there myself
'Next lunar rotation be here
'Do not bring supplies or any unusual

Slave shot back

'There are never deer in this valley

Todd put it simply

'Then up there is your proof
'There a way out of the valley

Late spring-night on school-grounds

Groupings of tables by ledges 
Scene lit by yellow circles of outside-lights

Rear the school at the lunch-yard
Out-of-sight of any police passing
Too large a pack to heed security-guards
Security-guards rather-not call the police

Three packs joined up at this spot
A rollerblade crew invited by Scotty

Jewels stunted large

Ben of the undernet

Short-board-kid laid out a yarn in admiration

~hella-yea-boi

'Even soldt KEY$
'To three! teachs at school

$KEY pronounced ski

Short-board-kid counts off

'dealers second-handers hobos 
'taco-stand ...

Short-board-kid called out 

'Troy

Troy ethralled by the spell of watching Jewels stunt around
Dragged from the show

! Jewels
`Yo that inhuman
! We cant compete 

Jewels kicked up into flip
Shrugging-shoulders

~ so 

Troy blushed in appreciation
Needed a moment to calm down

Kid repeated again

'whats your weridest $KEY sell

Troy twirled his long-board 
Hopped on it in nose dive

'your mom is one

Dropped a 5-stair & rolled back
Troy backed the short-board-kid off 

'No joke I was at HEB

'Your mom talked to some other lady
'Recognized me & ran over

SBK got all up on him
But he didnt let up

'Please do you have a KEY dollar-sign

'Im all like uh... ski

'ohhh then she started to beg
'like a dog in front of bacon
'all drooly n wanting the meat

There was a less-than-friendly rumble
The most notable hurtful being the grunt

'Couldnt say no to a 
'your-mommy-sloppy
_

Just-learned-ollie-skater quick-shot Ben for points
Ben took up the offer to challange

The trial elongated as was the Bluff
Here without gray-clay
Appreciation bounced him since

Ben using Tome as a ramp
Rocketed on the table

bunny-hop-table-to-table 

Each table in line hit 
360 to land

A flash-of-ginger took him immediately
Full-body into a dense bush

Jewels taught Ben using her Tome was not okay
Ben angry-as-hell

'Hey I tested it out
'Did you a favor

'If it can hold me
'It may hold your cave-man-ass

Too-family in a friends-situation
Jewels burned of the energy of the insult 

All enjoyed the scene as proud-witness
Ben squeeled over & over like a pig

Ben's embarassmant eased eazy after
Night unmarred all kept to good moods

Rollerbladers yell all-sniff-up

! now lets tag-tonight
~ school forever marked in memory of tonight

Punks now demolished & tagged automatic-in-response
Freshman-blader a veteran prepared with an assortment of cans
_

~ BEWARE of the Esoteric Order
A colletive work 
Fenced off preserved as art as if comissioned 
Festive in the spirit of Dagon

'fk-da-police
'jen-ben-dun
(skyline of Titty-top-you-less)
(anarchy sign)

With the plenty others, washed well off after a year of service
Rollerbladers caught later & injustly linked-to-all 
_

Deep-night split-up & regrouped at an abandoned lot
Rollerbladers promised dirt hills for the bikes

Calm pure-humidity of early-morn
World slowly warmed to activity in the start of a new day

Troy lit up a Black & Mild
Tabacco cigar wrapped over a wood filter

Rollerblader fronted

'We do this all the time
'Tonight was best of all

? Yall nights all like this

Jewels stood up passing the blunt

~study worse over school

Long-night of renegade-fuckery
Body battle-worn from jukes & tricks

All weary for sleep went own ways
Cops be on look-out the next days
_

Mid-day weekends before summer
Packs out still-energized of reserves from long-winter-months

An old bank
A neighborhood spot

It didn't offer any advantage exceptional
Cept for a long-mostly-smooth-lane

Kids here got rocket-ollies well-worked

Jewels caught breath
All else in hopes to talk to her

A crowd teleported to her after the trick 
Mostly kids who only hyped due to hype of other kids

Scotty & dealers under a tree in pow-wow
He hustled edibles-Jewels-made at a high price

Turnt on pull yet confident enough to transact
Dealers sagging Jinco jeans eyes-low-chill

'Dense bro
'Sure man we 

OG coughed out the Black & Mild 

~cough-oh-geezzz-too-high

'Yo Erick get the wad

He turned back to them

'Yea we will get the lot

OG approved openly to the scene

'Scotty is cool

All quickly resumed as if uninterrupted
Dealer motioning to break-out-here

Grinder-skaters set a pipe between trucks on a skateboard
Erik unscrewed pipe & popped out wads

'We hot
'so yall know

Dealer fished out a free nick sack & flung it at Ben

'Our product legit Jamaican 
~fresh-bomb-out-thick

Scotty shot back
'It got a name

Dealer smiled pleasantly
'There was a reason I didnt mention it
'But here it goes

'syrupy-as-SOUR-Gushers-stuffed-in-bag-hot-day
_

Posers & wanna-bes left-with-birds at sunset
Skate-pack stayed to get real-work-done

Tricks-stunt-extreme sure no noob to-crash-into-you-from-nowhere

Jewels busy at the run-way back-n-forth
Zealous as an itch long-needed-scratch

Grinders chip-to-shit fine-ledges of stone workmanship
-life-errodes
Long-since weathered grafiti to explain to bank execs

South Side rich kids rolled in with a over-sized-Texas-truck 
They had recognized Jewels & swung around to park

Rollerbladers lept from the bed
Each hauling a rail over their shoulders

Each-in-turn busted on the rail 
krew-vs-krew tournament with the trophy respect 

Clay skin-glinted-in-sweat skated up to his crew not-in-line 
The best at Miller & the best on this scene as Jewels didn't count


'aww shit man you see what I busted-out 
'540 chuck-norris to 180

'AND I got that photo-pose

Clay shouted back to the crowd around the rail

'We be bust'n on that rail like Bukake 

Clay turned back to lean in close to Jewels

'Jewels tell me you seent it

Jewels nodded leant on her bike
Rollerblader offered her the swig of vodka-Mtn-Dew

He stopped her

'Waterfall-only-the-rule 

The others around had each perched to get next sip
Gave the rollerblader his just dues

Clay called ou

!Abe 

'Get a rotation yo

Abe hooted agreeably trying to impress the dealers & the scene phat with rich-kids
He pulled sag-up & flipped sack out folded in the sagged-Jinco-jeans

! bout-time
! imma-learn-yall-up-son

'This is how Miller rolls dat 
'Cherry Blunt

Clay spoke up

'You still got grape

Abe made a bounce at it

'If there are two in a pack
'& We just smoked one

'hmmm Clay 
'you need math

Abe chuckled foretelling his future

'Koreans gonna rob you at the cornerstone

Clay unimpressed

'Hey Abe

~ Yeah

Clay blew-him-a-burd

'Watch this kid 
'Imma trick this shit

'awwwww yeaaah

Jewels shot back a tip-of the head
Standing aside her bike

Her smile a big-flash-of-white

Clay distracted crashed & flipped ass-over-rail
_

Dealer in circle ready in turn for the puff-puff-pass

'We all go to Carol
'Gonna hit a few spots after this one

'No rent-a-cops

Truck large enough to pack three krew
Up-n-over Harbor Bridge to the North Beach Acquarium

Lexignton & abandonded attractions 
_

6am dropped off back at Staples street

Abe passed Jewels the wood-tip-cigar
Smoke let out in a thick cloud all around on curb under tree

All reeked pleasantly in mellow-tabbaco-stench

Early-morn & hungry no lunch
Clay called out more-wishful-than-hopeful 

! A Run-Run 

Attempting to inspire a grab & dash
At a elderly corner-store open down Staples 

All pretended to buy into the plan until the arrived at street-nexus 
Their real intention revealed split ways home

Clay disappointed but expecting the reaction

'Ahhh I see how it is

'Yall aint so hard man
'Yall go home to a fridge 

~ but man
'I got to crash at Dorsey

'His place broke-as-fuck
'We gonna eat bread again

Dorsey shook the patch of locks back & forth

'nah nah man 
'I aint going there

Moms new boyfriend a muthrfkr
Dorsey leant on Jordan

'shit Jordan hook us up with a crash
'we got no where to go near here

Jordan always the gatekeeper for their krew-spots

'Come on Jordan you know us man

Jordan knew this day would come
The day others would need to come to the Dunes

For this purpose Jordan had built a big-ass-obstruction
Conglomeration of rusted-car-tires-sand-sack-logs

Place looks like it been there decade
That the point of the turn-off-marker 

He moved the marker every couple months to throw off the trail
.
.
.
Summer breezes of salty air 

Sweat drained-un-ending off forehead & back
Out each day harder-than-before on stunt at hand

rail drop gap stair ledge slope
Farvorable lanes to secluded places like cemeteries

Different day conjoined to different krew
Corpus large but local-skaters kept certain spots 
_

Krew from Ray had two legit-kids 
Home-practice 1337 to bust-out-public

Novel technique unlocked at an early age got Jewels jealous

Flip'n their boards like coins
Yet each time 100% right
Total dominance of the 50% random-factor

Jewels day-long in ginger-sparky-red-flame
She her fails as great of her triumphs

Youngsters fueled in the cockiness of imporessing a Legend
Mission to bump off the legacy of older-generation 

new-kids-on-block
_

Miss always patched her together
Miss usually drunk wine in nest

Helps deal with the turmoil of bmx-legend
Miss all slurs & rants in unexpected-surgery
_

Last spot stuck far to east-side 
Trajectory askew by the sun & drugs 

Jewels rolled her iconic fat-cuban-roll
Blunt enfused to get them back-at-it

Potion unexpectedly reversed
Dumped them there square dead

Friend-of-guy came thru for solid
3am no-where-to-go-for-miles

Friend-of-guy wtf called outside well-past-midnight
Took-moment to dawn on him this mob now his problem

13 Bodies piled into a room, living-room, & garage
Dead-tired & able to pass out on anything

Morn a swift-sweep by a triggered-step-dad 
Jordan trolled on his way out to help add fuel

Tired-each parted to re-sleep else-where

Lazy Sunday dragged into afternoon-ride
Crash-out & woke up well-after-necessary

Core-krew out long-hitch with just-met-company
Offer to join on-the-whim presented & krew accepted offer

Out towards East Texas wood-land hills
Famous river too-far for their home-town 

Ride would continue North towards Oklahoma
But they assured a ride back to Corpus

Jordan confirmed the way back much easier
Griends paid a tube & a bus upriver

Todd spoke up to the clerk
Miss had whislpered to him from under shoulder-patch

'How much
'To be dropped off at the furthest?

Ben commented
'Dont be rude

Clerk broke-in only happy to settle the matter with good-vibes

'Its the same price
'We only drive full-runs

Todd in executive decision decided

'Be careful 
'High waters been known to white-water

Clerk looked at them serious

'Be careful high waters
'Here been known to white-water

'Yall git scared
'Just ride it out
'Camp o'r nite

Clerk looked up at Jewels assured

'By morn heavy rain-water set back slow
_

Robbins-family parted as quickly as had been met

Jordan parted thankful

'Thanks we wont forget this trip
'Only caz of yall
_

Dropped off alone out there hours 
Only a enraged river front

Driver made them promise to camp till morn
Todd did very sincerely

Jordan started to lash his pack to a tube
As soon as vehicle-left

'fk-dat-yo
'live for experience

No had reason to object
Each had two tubes, Jewels four

Tome had a reversible set-up
Food packed aside Tome as the safest location

Sun strong on them sweating
Jordan noised them all into assemple

! CARRRUMMMPPHHH

'Each has an extra tube 
'Guard each pack as if it own

'Shout out
'Person behind alerter
'Responsible for alerters pack-tube

'Todd agreed to roll 2 packs
'So he will be last

'Tubes will be tied in a long raft
'Each rides along a side

They entered the water in a run
First Jewels & Todd 
Then the raft, Jordan, Ben

At first the conglomeration of tubes difficult
Then after that first rough pach of river all calmed

Todd inturrupted the peaceful break in sudden yells

'Around the turn
'Just us get thru this gorge

'Around the turn
'Just us get thru this gorge

Todd completely correct
Miracle forgotten so long of a turn

First-time experiences pale against dire-fright of next-hours
Severe-situations caused severe-fights which caused severe-situations
A vicious cycle

Ben broke his waterfall with boulder against his lower-back
Because the momentum was mostly forward serious damage avoided

Down river miles thru woods & ravines
All tumbled with them down-river

Animals would not approach the banks
Needful but patient they awaited a calm time

River finally pleasant & mellow
Each bleeding & exhausted from long-fright

Jewels had flipped-her-bit on Miss

Todd spoke for Jewels loud enough for Miss to get the message

! YOU ARE SMOKING CRACK IN  MY BODY 
! YOU-CRINKLY-WRINKLY-BITCH

This fight in middle of Jordans frantic orders to untie the tubes
Conglomeration of tubes a deadly-dumbassarie
_

Jordan pointed-out the approaching nightfall
Entirely relaxed leant against tube chewed cheese

'Go where we want all day

'Just set up camp
'At any these 
'beautiful bays at hand

'They got god-damn-sand

'oh-shit-Jewels
'!look

Across an ebb nested by dense-thicket

Nightshade-of-The-Witch dipped just above water-level
Jewels in a shudder of emotions unable to describe

Jewels drew out her dagger
Razor-sharp in respect of the plants & cat-skin she worked with day-to-day

She chose a bud from the bad & sliced
Set the bud in her preserving-sand

Jewels after time was known disappeared
Else-thought she been gathering longer
Expected it on how happy she was

TOME left there aside as she followed on a path
Thru the woods late at night without-word

Jordan flipped-a-bit 
A fit only learnt by Ben's example

! pack-this-shit-up

! RRRRAAAAAARRRRR

Jordan roared out to the world

'I will blaze my trail tracking her

'Ben double-check Todd's work

Todd gifted-him-the-burd
_

Breakdown & repack took the last of day-light

Ben excused by Jordan now flipped-his-own-bit
Expected she sure as shit be back by the time we are done

Cursing now that past hours time
Which was admittedly better after 
Hours of the the monotonoous call 

A shout full-volume

'i-see-the-fucking-moon-favor
'we-go-far-one

! she-leaves-us-behind
'she gives 0 shit

If Jewels returned she would immediately follow Jordan's signature blaze
Yet they fed off the crumbles which Jordan had to inspect much to find

Jordan by full-moon tracked the traces of her movement
Ben & Todd eager to learn from a master

Mud of puddles the best signs
Of what had passed near its region

Jewels Dr. Martin bootstompers hard in passage

Beavers damned springs & creeks which fed to the river
Lily bloomed bogs kept all muddy  to Jordan's favor

All huddled over one
Jewels-foot-print clear as day

'bitch is near 

Work a great trial to push him past his limits
Power of her gait crafty in elusive ways

Everyone exhausted

Ben threatened a promise he knew he could never keep
Todd exerted a monumental victory in the feat to keep-silence

They had two choices when they packed
Bring all but the tubes & ropes or set up camp

Todd had them haul the load 
Himself borne down by the TOME

Todd climbed up to the second-layer of a tree

'Just over the next knoll an opening

Jordan jumped at it
Confirmed by the collision with Jewels tread

Open grounds restful, compared to the pain of bushwacking
Each lifted of spirits knowing this the last of the thickets

A small valley brought a lone knoll into view opposite end
Boys bushwacked-thru expecting to confront Jewels at any moment

Wiccan conjury became apparent
With each passing doll or carved-symbol each forgave Jewels a bit more

Evidences of decades of lonliness wore all the decades since 
Grayness of age overgrown by the dense-green-fugus-of-life

Satchets attached to trunks of trees
Idols & tokens to ward off unwelcomes

A great totem pole confronted valley passage
Meticulously carved yet warped by time

At ease now 
Thicket behind them the last

Todd remembered from time with Jewels

'To lose sanity
'Only wanting home

'Basically thats what this does

A dark-garganteun-cloud cut all moon's light
True they all were insane already & Dunes remembrant

Spooked pack with Jordan led
Feel of his soles led the way

Todd thoughful left
Ben agressive right

Alleyup Jewels
also-known-as
Micheal Fly'n Jordan

They could all travel 
Aided likewise to bushwack
Aun empty of the superhuman power of Jewels

Now here a place
So long hard fought-faith

Testified front blissful

Overgrown by decades
Up pathed knoll 

Breach summit at turn of climb

Caught there several seconds
Able with the skin to feel
Tho blind summit


Cloud finally past
Thicket broke as if by magic & slight hump of slope
Panorama of peaceful mellow meadows of flowery greenary

Jewels deep in meditation
Front the doors
Tired just-got-there

~oh fk my friends
~fk i hate when they do that

~oh shit Miss
~what do I do

Purposefully loud & long cries
Drown out any response by Miss

She also sees this pleasant sight
Her troubles all vanquished 
Only the echoes of those few moment's infinity

Boys on the other hand
Drew up quite a stir

She had to train the pack again
Build a better bond

bruised-boys-learnt-lesson
_


Poisonous thickets & large-maned-spiders guarded over gateless hinges

Wild cats
First one then slowly others

/// over harem inside a small cave
/// Groves of marijuana & catnip

Jewels in an open meadow
Standing there with Miss

Front a great-hut of a mother-witch
mother-witch being grand-master

Cat & Coon kittens together playful
Moon-lit door-less open gateway

Omen welcomed the new-comers

Great well of water out front

Blue-gray stone all overgrown
Dark-greens moss & light-green vines 

Couple of kicks of Jewels
Threw back the world-off-course

Front-thick oak-door stubbonly flew across room
Fireplace pick scattered thrown across floor
Stone-exploded yet door held entact
_

Jordan quickly enamored with him self
Bugged Jewels in to the con of making all an shroom-elixir

Jewels needing to get busy con them into drinking it
Goys easily affected on shrooms would be out of her way

Marshmello & neon kelidoscopes thru a lost land
Transported by a unicorn guide

Jewels put her heart into it
_

Trippy-now in discovery

Smell of aromatic herbs proved beauty of the witch

Robe thin around waist & busty above
Had a master-craft towards beauty

Oak-chests after centuries dry & preserved
Jars of what happens after centuries sealed

By some magic printinely preserved

A snake of great lengths uncoiled from center of firepit

Jewels broomed the snake out to the meadow

Snake took to its tail
Stopped first get a long gaze of Jewels

Crows cawed & flocks arrived
Fire ablaze & boys over-worked in spring-cleaning

Far-past-too-high-too-realize-they-cleaning

Door a sturdy work-bench for Jewels 
Her strength crafted her a sturdy to the core work-bench

Tome-spread-eagle
Packed-of-new-entries

bowls jars kettles papers books clohes 
seeds bound-letters preserved-herbs

Fish-bone long no.7 out & cleaned
Ink rubbed into service

Learnt of her old master
Now presence of a different master

Keh Kay Gen Kai
Conjoined of two 

Witches each drastically-different
Yet common themes apparent

Hut preserved mostly-only the better for the wear
Work the sweep of what accumulates after decades

Gigantic cauldron over kitchen hearth glimmered-clean
Black Obsidian shined sleek

Gunk nothing against the buff of vigorous Jewels

squirels bats birds mice cats
All stole glances thru windows

Mice aun rode the felines
Yet cats regarded greater than mice

A fox cawed out fondly at front the door
Jordan rewarded it onf of his a dried-fish

Fox took the tip & skat off

Great-beam of moon bore down
Bright light kept all up

Jewels a slave-master always ordered chaos of trips-into-a-chore

~monotony helps the high
~mindless generate generic power
~used explicitly for a techique
_

grand-old-pecan to the left cottage overtook 3/4 of the bedroom
Braches of nuts inside the house in an organic fuse

Rear-double-doors suited to barrow out the ashes
Incineration a pleasant purge into dust

A great mound of ashe accumulated by next noon day 
Jewels had the boys mud-paste-ashe hours later next drink

An island-table boulder lay flat & stable
Molded by unknown means to have several drawers

Jordan cleared out a rotted-cupbord
He pulled a rusted pot & triggered a trap

Trap turnt past-worn-boredom into panic
Arrows flung & whipped-roots-lashed 

All poisonous 

Message carved over the slab that released the weapons 

~FEAR WITCH
~AS SNAKE
~AFTER DEATH

Poisonous after all these decades
Minor-severe wounds to all

Jordan pissed his pants
Tho blood made it hard to tell

Jewels just shrugged off the pulls 

~ no panic
~ all good

Jewels in lust as if this a long-waited-test
At her table 
Prepare ointment via herbs & flowers outside counteract the poison


Jordan asked confused

'da-fk wit her

Then the burn became audible out his mouth

! IIITTT BBBBUUUURRRRNNNNSSSSS

Meditation into nothing whilst Jewels concoct anti-dote

~ every witch grave
~ other witch treasure

Anti-dote instant relief
Pain & suffer turnt to relief

Ease as celluar massage
Purge cellers to better forms

Enlightenment lost-at-stiches
But regained quickly after patches 
_

Week went by comfortably

Jordan installed thorn-thicketeries
A blend he was able to morph in his odd al-chemic-wayz

After two summers own bushcraft naught penetrate barrier
Key out-tunnel down the 20-ft wide-well led out bypasse thorn-barrier

Journey much faster than the threat to retreat and manage position
Impossibly barred by a thorn-thickets too-green-to-burn
_

Field bloomed Kung-Fu energies in Todd to energize chi-root
Lessons of the soil & rock & root 

Three times a day

Jewels always the master of all
Boys needed to best her at one


Ben near insane & entirely difficult to deal with
His brain flips-a-bit when his last-battery-power-zeroes 

Jewels enthusiastic outmatched Ben's fits
Ben learnt to master himself in the corner sober
_

Dunes at ocean of transient-energy
Hut staurated with passionate bloom of seasonal-energies

Tabacco of this Witch's leave fused with methol 
Thick sweet cloud perfect for ring-wars

Zone energies thrived in Jewels invigorated presence
Champions bloomed all in the coranation of the new witch

Third night without sleep
All left of witch consumed in mind 

~no energy
~energy equal quantum-pure

Jewels summoned the Witch
Boiled flower & herbs inside couldron 

Audible-phantasm-aun-boys-heard
Wicked rasps of power 

Miss cowerd in her nest
Boys huddled together 

Boys ordered outside into the dark-night
Jewels weilded a two faggots
Handed one to Jordan & Todd 

~ witch bones in the well 
~ Ben help lower Jordan down

Ben looked at her

'Do not ask this of me

Jewels repented

~no sorry

~you doing it

Ben immediately launched into well

Jewels wanted to remind him to aim for the dark-spots
But he should know that by now-right

Jordan achored Ben with a rope to help with the fall

Ben via GriGri descented down

Yuck-of-narrowness of forever-dank-places
Centuries old civilizations & dominions
Upset by this unprecdented-passage of Ben

Ben almost water level caught of eye in moon-light
Yellowed bones stuck inside stone-wall
Buried as if climbed up on own volition

Ben forced to kneel down to collect all the teeth
A fine-sand-bed made the search certain

Jordan tossed-down a-make-shift broom
To scrub the well-moseleum-bottom 

Half-heartedly
Only that one-soaked-water over a week
 
A pyre erected over the mudpit in the middle of the field
Bones full of tumors now burnt to dusk 

Ashe planted in soil of the greenary

~ she not teach me
~ only  her burial
~ now gone forever

Miss explained

~ oh she taught you 
~ enough already
~ you bless-god & give-thanks

Tomes two sided 
Each the crest of her celestial-sisters

Equals each her to other

Both passed in the manner of flame
Under full moon

Lonely hermit endowed fondness for the fortune of burial of friend
Impossible in circumstance other-wise

Decades of wander alone 
Accompanied back to dust of entropy
_

Each in-the-shits due from a pecan-mostly-diet
Each gone farther than possible due to Jewels

Much passage of time
Before they would return

Wild herbs & pecan salads 
Jewels always kept pouches of oils & spices & herbs
She almost always made anything delicious 

Line-of-Felines  & Clusters of Mice instructed to duties
Principles passed down genereation to generation in royal line

Jordan worshiped by the mice who repaired his gear with lesssons of embroidery learned
Mice vests that proved the position of the mouse in society

Felines mixed over generations with a great many lost-cats 
Pets taken by owners too-close to river
For-ever stranded down-river

Lost & terrified pets assimilated into a hill infested by cat-harems

Packs of the females ferocious
Idle males muscular yet Scooby-Doo cuddly
_

Chores
Water-plants hunt-bug
pick-n-dry-n-store 

Chores cats tho distracted constantly managed eventually to complete
Even if act took a week
Enlongated to serve their pride & meaningless days

Chores mice took on immediately
Eager to resume business-as-usual of mousey-life
.
.
.
Starved of food burst in on a camp-site
Look like all escaped from jail

Friendly-gathering easily took in the pack
Fed & drunk gluttonous after dire-necessity

Locals to Corpus offered ride back out truck-bed

// Dropped under hot sun 
// No-where-cross-roads

// Stuck 5 hours midway at the next hitch
// Back in Corpus by night 

ck to the Dunes crashing waves beat welcome 
Waves beat in welcome crashes against the rock-out-cropping-of-rocks perimeter of Dunes
Splashes truly warm greeted them in reunion

Next days only light sun & chilly relaxation
Cold wind came by & blew over
_

Scotty led broke-skaters a mini-group of scavangers

The newest annoyed Jordan
Scotty punished them with a supply-run

Obligated by the simple fact

'Where else can you sleep & chill tonight

Five grateful poor-bastards from Miller High
Krew grateful for hands to prepare Friday-Pre-Dagon-Eve-Party

Bluen moonshine from the Bluff 
Drunk straight it glowed-green-tint 

DJ Ryder pulled up 808s & trucks
Alone his three truck entourage called all to party

Drawn deep as center city

Local krews from all regions present
Skaters bladers bikers punx dealers rednecks thugs
United where attendance defined legit each equal other

Party wild till dawn 

Jewels spiked the drink to morph the moonshine a color deep purple

Ben signed titties & had a super-star-night
Father of a worldwide network originated here hometown 

Prep for this party USB depleted world-markets 

Party named USB 

USB or you dont get in
Each left with a bootable-unix USB

Todd & Jordan & Jewels all envious of Ben
Especially Jewels who expected to have attention
Or atleast most of it but never none of it

Ben dawned as a White Rabbit 
Pick-of-the-litter adored him 
Floppy-bunny-ears & floppy-titties

Dagon Eve a region-wide mandatory-holiday 
Open-celebration along bayfront highway end-to-end

Pagan ritualistic sacrifice-feast
Endeared-centuries-tradition

Animal roasted on spic-over-barrel-fire
Carved as chosen-member of the social-unit 

Honey & chili-based meat-glaze 
Unique family-heirloom-recpie

Chosen-member draped in semblance of animal
More nude for better time a well of a good-time
Help the community endure hard-long-years

Home-brew-beers central to festivities
Lightness of heart bubbled by South-Texan hops

City entire over age of thirteen out bay-walk rain-or-not
Long & open bay front street sectioned-off for festival 

Grill-pits flamed center-road
A peaceful-time local-to-local

Sections of the bay held long-standing-reputations span past-generations
Each pit the pride of a social-unit this year to gain fame & the best titties

Fishy-overtones-of-spice unsettled strangers & gwakers 
Ritual symbolism another odd-repellent of non-locals

Roads shut-down as final detterrant for strangers
Gawking-instigator-tourist favored by stampede-of-children

special
An unspoken byword  year-round

Children swarmed together
Adults dare not interfere

Mobs infested entire blocks of street
Raided pills like candy

Drug-stores kept carved-pumpkins full of pills front doors in a tithe lest incur damage
Intricacy of detail to assuade rambunctions children delight in smashing-pumpkins not glass

Maniacal-craze of drugged-up kids moved monolithic cloud
Children march triumphant in songs of blitzed-dominance

A certain child 

Appointed by inexplicable manners
Empowered to tag a target special

Waves & waves of minature-viciousness
Docile mask cast aside for this night

Faces painted by deamonic-embrance
Toddler till age of thirteen

Never resist the attack & shame
Reprisal against entire neighborhoods if a gunshot heard

Shooter's house burnt down
Ashes all them & close-kin
Multiplied out to neighbors

Return from festival to burnt-abodes
A lesson many well learnt last decade

Social-force kept all from being tagged special in neighborhood by noting-all-present
Bayside road alone the safe place to gather in the relief of security against a looming fear of children
_

Alley after dusk
Jordan set the tarps & locks over the bikes

Rustle of chains brought the attention of a patrol-policeman
PoPo lights blup demands for attention from the surprised-krew

'Hey what you doing back there

On instinct all jumped a wall into a multi-level-park-lot 
A second set of cops executed a close-in 

Forced to the terrible option of only ascending
Driven like cattle Jewels hoiseted them up levels

Four ran their asses off doomed layer after layer hopeless
Sound of the squeels of tires closer & closer

Obvious situation near empty lot

a small voice hissed

'ged-outta-here
'dont get us caught

Behind a parked-van emerged head-only of five huddled skaters from Miller

another voice wailed 

'police bank bail after arrests
'my moms a going to kill me for the bill

A final voice commanded

'shut tha fuck up Timmy

'you got them called
'breaking that window noob

Light drew out Shorty from the shadows

'oh-hella-yeah-yall 
'Jewels

Saved kid-in-distress startled by the look of distress left on Jewels face

'You can just like obliterate the cops all HeMan
'right?

Jordan front-in to step off the fool

'2 cars plus backup
'We are all trapt

'We got chased here
'Yall dumbass hid here

Dick-head not back

'Hey we good 
'We chill here

'Yall go get arrested
'They aint seen us

A little freshman spoke-up
About to lay down wassup

'Yall chill
'check-this 

No where to go & the PoPo around the corner
Immediately all submitted to the plan of the freshman
_

PoPo out car on floor just-below
Side-by-side they walked up ramp 

Out here his far these were their victims

Larger cop cursed

'fuck quotas Gary can suck my nutts
'like his wife did
'when she drunk-drove last year

Partner agreed

'These brats are gonna pay

'Tell-you-me
'I want a second shot if she gets chosen this year

'Before she turns 40 

10+ in one voice yelled

'SSPPPPEEEEEHHH
'SCCCCIAAALLL

shit-pants-flight-for-life 
fk-out-there-no-second-thought
_

Congradulations & aundulations 
The freshman now titled The Freshman

Ben told Shorty

'ping bounty x 1000 
'put word out tonight

'many new nodes legit-rich

Jordan put in solid interupt

'Get them $KEY buyers lit

Wordless Shorty ended the convo

'oh we gonna be hot on dat
'sure-thang

Shorty invited at Ben the UnderNET king

'My hoods have the best salooloah-dogs
'Come & tell everyone yourself 

'Get hype up 
'People see Ben & Jewels there

'I got this cuz hella-set
'shit-son Jewels promise
'all-yall want me help hook-up

Jewels audibly turnt from second-mention

Ignorant Shorty oblivious

Jordan tried to shift focus for Ben's sake

'Tonight we break into Driscol
'Gonna flash Uni Hospital

'By the time Uni realizes
'Nodes will be worth too much to turn down


The Freshman displayed his pack of cans

'Damn the Uni 
'Ballsy

His pack displayed cans of assortment

'ohhh dude
'we could all tag it yea-ah

Dickhead smacked Freshman in back

'You will seriously go with them
'Go 
'Let me see 
'Get on 

Dickhead fronted him

'Yeah kid think before you speak

'Alright Jewels & rejecks

'Imma hit me up
'Them salooloah-dogs

Dickhead shouted from the otherside of the ramp entrance

'Me & my cuz run by Uni on way back tonight
'Chill there on a case of iced-40oz

'Yall need help
'Just gotta yell real loud

'We will throw you a beer

Fateful tree & familiar ledge
Exposed to Downtown for that brief moment

Catch-breath on the adrenaline
All-out for all to see

Moon in a bright glow
No lights to the shadows

Shadows kept off the sun
Shadows kept one hidden

Todd unlocked the window
Neatly all entered to obscurity of shadows

Driscoll derelict under the Uni
Familiar halls turnt haunted

First stop Jordan's locker
Extreme-other-end-of-school

Lust-lost-fervor a torch in the darkness to keep courage
Carnage left from the riots to the Hunt

Not quiet on the empty halls

A light sprang on far-faint-down-opposite-end
Krew froze Miss attuned her listening device

! HEARD
! SUM
! TIN

She near let out an abombidably-loud-scream
Jewels predictive-hands clasped the cry silent

A giant shadow clambered about

Thick door raised from the stairwell
Light bore fantastic shadows into the wall across

Shadows warped the head too tiny for so great a body
A enourmous torso wearing a diapers with a gnarly hook

Loud yet more subtle voice echoed

! DAGON

! EVE

! DIM
! WIT 

Shadows departed quick as appeared

Jewels 'whispered' angrily

~ gdmit-fk-it
~ told yall
~ shut-the-fk-up
_

Locker & Jordan fk-all

Fits of elation in unencumbered-desire-unleased in full ravish of the Giant Panda Bear
Panda Bear authentic Japanese & so finely made that most people would fk-that-panda

Action quicker than any could turn away 

Jordan humped the dust off it
Till it clean now him covered

Over as quick as it begun

Streams of sweat ran down proud-panting-happy-face
Panda tied around his pack in a giant hug

Jordan said coyly in an out-of-character-voice 

'GPB

'You were right to believe
'I would one day rescue you

Jordan shat on metaphysics
Except if in any way substantialized personification to GPB

(or any other omens he wore like pendants)
_

Down the halls back towards the hallway
Closet with the printer set up by Ben to crack the key

Todd mello since morn

Girl who shit-so-bad & his foot dunked in it
He definitely wished her dead in curses
Torment of a day with shit-in-shoe

He saw her
Maybe
Well felt like her & that is enough

Mestration blood of girls
Blood he naively took as rust

Patients blood from blood layered on elevator cords
Young Women & teachers devoured in a lust that left a mark

Consequence to his actions
Todd to himself thru the fiasco Jordan & now Ben created
_

Now down the halls back towards the hallway
Closet with the printer set up by Ben to crack the key

Closet-door opened expelled compressed-air-thick-in-chemicals

Ben raised his skank over his nose
He patted Jordan thankful on his back

Algorithmns in the code proved sound  
Faith strong into a mania this step must-happen

Krew off to themslves at other ends of the hall
Ben this anxious flips-a-bit guranteed
(oddly in victory the fit is worse)

Jordan off to himself
high-way pleasure-lane-reunion-bay
_

Long-passage thru cleaning instruments 
Sweat of nervous-energy to Ben's brow

Ben reached the end
Behind where stairs descended
In-darkness hands found the printer

Ben caught of heart
Nothing had printed

Panic-auto-pilot-hands fumbled open the paper tray
Paper-tray found empty & that fact-slapped-face

An error of life had failed
not his algorithmn 

In that he must find some light
But he only found himeself alone in darkness

ben-bit-flipt

Printer flung here & there til it was no-where-mostly

A heavy cartiedge fell to a soft-thud
Fall softened by-layers-of-paper

Ben found one to lift up

White paper glowed in darkness
Dark sane patterns obvious 

Paper after paper
Proved same pattern

Hundreds identical
Proof after time-stemped proof

Ben's embarassed apology quick
Each he gave stacks of paper

'I am under lotta stress

'alright-fk-yall
'lets-go-im-ready

Ben herded them to continue on
Each give a stack of paper

'Guard these with your lives
_

To the tunnel door hard to open

Jordan struggled more than at any lock-pick
Submitted to handsigns & only then able to work-it-out
Larger more rudimentary-picks used genericly worked-it
_

Up the tunnel cords below to an aybss
Trick to wipe them for blood on ascent past first two levels of the Uni

Skipped the first two floors of patients

'Add these new $KEY headers to all our INIT

INIT meant a usb loaded to flash a computer into a unix node on the Undernet

usr-initiates host to the network
host-initiate fills usb with $KEY

net banks pay out $KEY

usr -> usb -> intiates -> host
host -> usb -> $KEY -> usr

Krew released into the easter-egg-hunt

Rebuild the kernels of the network was only a plug-in & reboot

Hive-mind-survelient-system used against itself
Key allowed total interception & manipulation of traffic

Anonymous-only traffic based upon encrypted p2p web
Kernels critical nodes attached to the Undernet automatically

Order's great mission to replace nodes would swiftly give way to the power inherint in privacy
Months of rewiring & the ability to rework all computers individually to the old ineffienct network

Traffic One-Time-Only-Pre-Share-Keys-Anonymous tunnels
Bandwith of traffic improved 100-fold

Nodes contracted traffic to be proxy by other nodes
Aun still 10s times faster than old network
///////////////////////////////////
_

All now easily picked locks as experts

Network wires a simple trace to the network-box
These gateways the magic place to insert & reboot

Flash of unix kernel took several minutes

Todd stopped front a framed-photo on a desk
LOCHNAR 

Displayed in the penthouse of the building

Two hours enough for several floors
Now the krew powered behind his plan
