! Clank clak clik

Todd ran his hand down
Lockers lining empty-halls

15 Minutes past the bell
Point-of-no-return to class

Any student this late
Gets writ-up-locked-down

Ironically worse 
Than not arriving
To class at all

Todd kept countenance
To that figure 

Yet inspired himself
To no avail

`Devil has idle hands 
'When works harvest

Todd's purpose
Opposite direction
At a basement-closet

Years to plan
Today's venture

Despite such gravity 
Today could only insist
day-just-another-day

Pulled away 
Compelleled to floors above

Faith a trust alone
Led one clearly thru
A path taken full-stride

Latency became mounted
By endless-anticipation

Energy from day-dreaming
Now loomed-hurdle 

Todd's aimless feet
Steady thumps chronic

Step-after-step
Up stairs to higher floors

A peace appreciated
Halls only-ever bustling

Few rays of sun bore thru
Exposed dust-polluted air

Mellow ambience shattered
Patters of running-feet
Charged towards Todd's direction
From around the corner

Fortune placed Todd
Directly-opposite
The gurls-restroom

Distance leapt
One bound

Todd rushed last-stall
He let out a cocky-smirk
An instictual-ingenuity
To hide in the-gurls

Todd stood atop a seat

Crack yellowed-by-age
Proved long-perseverance

Despite Todd's trust 
The seat-cover broke 
 
!! KAK

Left-foot plunged ankle-deep
Hour-old piss & shit
A stale-mud-murk 

Door quietly opened
Someone made an attempt
To open the first-stall

A muffled-yell
Came from hallway

'BEN 
'WE KNOW 

'YOUR IN THE GURLS

Heavy-legs-kicked-door-open
near-cracked-the-door-in-half

!! BOOM

Unexpected-fright broke
Unprecedented-pressure
Into full-release

Entire school vibrated by
Broadcasts of anal-annoucements

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSS
!!! PPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP
!!! PPPPPLLLLQQQQQQIIIPPPLLLUUUUKKKKIII

Eruptions of great-masses 
Expounded epic-voyage in essays

Monitor hooted out 
Entire-building-to-hear

!!! GAWD
!!! DAMN
!!! BEN

!!! YOU SHOULDA SAID WHY
!!! YOU NEEDED tHe gah huRls

Trumpet gagged-quiet
Gas-particles bloomed-out
visible-thick-cloud

Room silent after door
Fell shut & resettled

Building rumbled angin
Synced unanimous giggles

Ben kicked at stall-door
Braced-shut by legs

!! PAT
!! PAT
!! PAT

'Gonna make your
'fat-cunt-trap

'Eat that shit
'you scabby-bitch

Todd turnt by comment
Stepped out the stall

Highly-un-called-for-words
git-learnt-by-beat-down

'Back off

Ben's vengance spun
To a lurch at Todd

unstoppable-tackle 
launched nuke

Todd's left-foot 
squirted-piss then caved

Todd hoisted by tackle
Slammed-hard against back-wall

Ben muffled vengeful

'YOU
'are the REASON
 
Ben positioned his advantage
Set forearms around Todd's neck

'I got 
'CHASED

Todd's hand flashed between 
His neck & arms-vice-gripped

Only couple fingers
A hold Ben knew trivial

Ben arrogant
Cleared victory

'walk...
'AROUND

'like you weren't 
'skipping class

'a teacher notified
'the monitors

Todd's  once trivial 
Wedge of fingers
Dug higher & higher up throat
Till whole hand pried
& Backed by muscular-leverage
A force that was unstoppable

Ben's startled grip evaporated

Bens-agressive-force
Turnt-against-himself

Todd set forearms
Now placed Ben
Into locked-hold

Ben blinded in defeat
Fought only to squeak out

'got-meeehhh 
'chased 

!down

After several curses & long-pause 
Ben surrendered raspt-breath

'Alright 
'ahhhh
'hole

'made yur
'Poinnn Tah

Todd pushed Ben off
To a safe distance

Toilet flushed
Another boy joined the scene
In the gurls restroom

Jordan blushed-out
Awkward introduction

'sup yall 
'Jordan here

Others speech-less heaved-air
Jordan obligated filled silence

'Sorry about that
'Im sick

Jordan scruffed
Unkept thick brown hair
Into a fluff

Two others only able to
Recouperate composure
-

Walls washed white
layer-after-layer

Unable to conceal
Caked-red graffiti

Extenuated by
Dark-recesses 
Tween tiles

Piss marked all
Feminine territory

If only the stain 
But mostly the smell

Curiosity here
Only met horrors

All repelled
From investigations

hot-box-gas-up

No where to go
Till class-period ended
_

Sound tickled Todd's ear
Enchanted burr
Tail-ends of echoes

Before Todd realized
He was interested
Drawn close to a wall

Todd startled 
Then reaffirmed

'There is a hum
'or maybe
'a whimper?

Todd looked to the others
Who bored-as-fk took interest

'Can you hear it

Jordan put in
As he neared

'Probably
'god-damn-ghost

Jordan yelled
At trash-can playfully

'School is 
'hella-haunted

'sk-a-dick 
! Bettsy burns-the-dick

Jordan started a story
Speech more toward the enviornment
More than at anyone

'back in the 50s
'life hella diff

Todd followed sound

Hum came from
Metal-vent-flap
Next to trashcan

Todd opened the lid
For better acoustics
Fingers smeared rust

Todd looked inside
Vent dropt to darkness

Todd yelled
At the darkness

'We can hear you

No sound responded
Only empty gusts

Jordan put jaw at Todd 

'You just high
'from fumes yo

'yeah sorry k
'its gross yes
'butt-fuck

'what-ever
'gets-you-high

'ya-knows
'wha-i-mean

'accept it
'n beeeee
'grateful

Todd's hand caught
Jordan's mouth 
Tounge & all

Call came softened
From great distance

( need help help )

A fullness-of-scream
Which rips apart throat-lining

( help us )

Jordan ventured
Tween Todd & vent
To yell
More in room 
Than in vent

'Here
'We Are Here

'Where Are You

( please help )

Jordan continued nearer
His juicy-phat-lips
Near kissed rusty-lid

'We hear you

'We will get
'THE PRINCIPAL

Todd moved Jordan
Out of the way
In time to get
Full brunt of next scream

( nnnneeeeeeehhhhhhoooooooooooo )

Shriek took all three
Back in a tight terror
pitch-to-curl-ear-hair 

Todd shouted down
Lid opened by both hands

'Who 
'Ever You Are

'Where
'Ever You Ae

'We Will
'Find You

Todd left immediately
Others followed dazed

To them it seemed
A reckless commitment

ten-min-to-bell 
Policy prohibits
Anyone out-in-the-hall

All Monitors
At Lounge on couch

Trio took to empty halls
Led by Todd

When able 
Todd explained

Thoughts brewed-years
Now fumbled out

Todd alone
Knew of the door

'I discovered

'a secret passage

'in a hall-closet

'When I got lost
'First-year fire-drill

'All year
'Been at myself

'To return to investigate
'Before graduation

'No chance ever came

'Yesterday I promised
'Id make it happen today

'Since first-year
'I planned
'How explore it

'Today is too much
'For coincidence

'A secret path
'Will lead us
'To that gurl

'I am certain

Todd empowered
By rambunctious company

Stairwells down floors

A small krew 
not-to-be-fucked-with

On-the-move 
Beaking all violations

All-in momentum
Moment they left the-gurls

Down halls of first-years

Todd continued

'When I got lost

'I felt someone
'Called me by-name

'I followed
'Tho less-than-a-handful 
'Heard my name

'At the end of the hall 
'Only a closet

'It was unlocked

'At first
'I only peeked in
'Out of curiosity

'Hard to say no
'Rep like Discrol

Jordan jumped in
Stewed for the chance

'Trust me yo

'You dont know 

~two-halves-of-it

Jordan's eyes lit up
Eyes & fat-lips wet

'One story
'ohhhh-sssmfg

Todd annoyed continued

'But
'At back of the closet

'There was a light-source
'Instead of shadow

Jordan perked in interest

Todd continued without offense

'I opened the door & entered
'To inspect

'There was an entry
'A long corridor
'Isolated from school

'Path went ahead
'For a long time

'Ended at black hole in a wall

'I am sure 
'It leads down

'Forced myself
'To go back

'Before I got
'Near enough to know

~goddam-creepy-place
_

Todd new the place of faith
Over vacancy of unafirmed-truths

Todd pace ahead determined
Pent-up-forces unleashed 
Propelled him unstoppable

Around windows 
Boy-at-a-time 
ninja-like

Stirred with brisk walk
Jordan expounded into story

'shit-free

'Most my papers for school
'All about school history

'Yo tho 
'One time research nz

'Caught me unexpected

~bored-n-shit

'tryna to look like
'Not here only for roof

'Thumb thru lots a papers 
'Research on first instance

Jordan shot both hands

'This floor

'Right so with that-in-mind

'no trip legit

! gawd-day-mmmm
! doe-yo

Jordan stopped them
Around a conrer
Safe between halls

'Newspaper authentic

Jordan hopped up
Accentation of emotion

'Janitor alerted authorities 

'They almost hug-up on him
'as nutt-case

'But then on call
'they heard him

~git-eaten-all-hell-alive

'Fleshy sounds & munchy-cruchy
'Huge masses of people chanting

'Mob from all over county
'Stormed Driscol

'Shit even back then
'People afraid-o-here

'shit-free

'all the cult-shit happened 
'according to multiple statements 

~on-the-muthrfkn:
~second-basement-floor

'First 
'Im like yall 

~Considering Uni Hospital first-floor
~To make this basement
'Mistaken as second-basement

'But then I remembered
'From previous research 

'The Uni built over Driscol 
'Not till ten years later

'I tried to correspond the story
'But nah-nada

'total-silence 

'Newspapers that entire month
'All missing

~she-he-it-son 
'I had access to the

Ben caught in respect
Familiar with the system

Jordan caught the gleam 

'Only copy 

'Physical copy 
'I was holding

'Stole that shit
'Now its framed

'One day it be wurf
'fat-wads

Ben nodded legit-approval
With a legit complement

'foe-show

Each panted hard
Traverse of three-floors

Each length of hall
Could crash journey

Nervousness strained
Fibers of the soul

Thru all halls unnoticed
System unvieled as weak
Out-matched by crafty-boys
Endowed by years-experience

Ben found a counter 
To the steam-roll-logic

'I been here
'All 3 years 

'If there were 
'multi-basement-levels

'There would be proof

'Reworked stairwell
'Modified to only move up

'I been on both sides
'The main-wells

'They as old
'As Miss Finely

Jordan added reverently 

~ may-the-cunt-bitch

Ben kept speaking

'Structural columns sufficent
'For three basements

'aint erased-no-mark

~fk-more-so

'All second-floor ceilings
'mangled-patch-work-shit-job
'From the Uni construction

Ben accentuated with a open-palm

'Uni had bank-ton-money
'That job still crap

'You both believe

'A stairwell
'Could disappear

'These stairwells created

~for-fks-sake
_

A closet door
Tucked towards 
Exterior-wall at-far-end 
Isolated past class-rooms 

Domino-effect
From past decision
Transpired step by step
Here a waypoint of fate

Todd looked thru
Closet-door-window

Small window exposed
A narrow janitor closet

Todd's sweaty palms
Slid on locked knob

Closet light on
Proved a back-wall
To the closet

Todd teary
cracked-ta-bitch

All momentum fell 
face-flat-mis-step 

Despite countless proofs
Human-heart only
Ever ready to doubt
More confirm all-else
Besides what experience promised

Jordan knelt in front
Took off his pack

Jordan pushed aside
The shattered-forelorn Todd

~got-dat
~be-chill

Jordan retrieved a pouch
Knelt down then stood up 

Door swung open
Pack back on Jordan's back
Before the two
Able to follow the action

Jordan not dismayed
Quickly entered

After two quick-movements 
Back-wall of closet
Opened-inwards

Jordan chuckled
Pointed to floor
A long arc scar

Swing of a door
Traced by decades

'Todd you shoulda
'seent yer face dog

'old-yeller

Narrow-corridor turnt
Elongated by distance
Horizons to infinity

Single-file eerie
Currents of course 

Corridor followed
Exterior-wall 

Endorphins flowed bounty
Answered oft-asked-questions

Ben admitted

'This is the true outer-wall
'Thats why winter
'Never cold first year

Jordan put in a chip

'Done the measurments
'Small windows were possible

'I always wondered
'Why no side had em

Ben explained on top

'Fire Marshall
'Got The Uni
'On fire-code

'Rather than expose this wall
'They dumped all that money 
'To build north-side-stairwell

'Remember 
'Whole week the Firemen
'Escorted people up to Uni 

Walls made of pilgrim-brick
Large thick & dark-purple

Brick-work-technique lost
Pilgrim-bricks all sold-off

Wealthy hoarded bricks
Bricks rumored to stop
Cannon-balls to cars

A marvel-of-wealth
Surrounded in bare tunnel

No back doors
To any classrooms 

Only long-passage
After long-passage
_

Back-end came up
Abruptly as blank-wall

Todd went busily 
In search of door from memory

Ben chirpt

'The architect
'Must have been a comedian

Jordan countered 

'Or hide access
'To an entire basement
'in tiny-as-tit closet

'Pilgrims times
'Were pirate times

'Bay too huge to defend

~for-gedda-bout-it

'Before all them 
~well-to-do-fk-you-fucks
'Bought up all bayside lands

'Back pirate times 
'Bay a scary hell

'Everyone had guns n knives
'Buccaneer pirates unpredictable

~sure-as-shit-sticks 

'Bucs raided every year
'One day alone
'Impossible to predict
'Army of pirates raided

'Most pirates they say
'Were actual city-folk

Ben added 

'Roy Miller Path

Jordan continued 
Interrupted

'Arcs right thru the bay
'This school at the head

'As far as any
'Buc ever went
'Often to kidnap kids

'Thats why
'We have that mott

-Once to Buc
-Always a Fk
_

Ben noticed on the old bricks
Symbols carved in peculiar diagrams
Sprawl of it typical of graffiti

Todd busy in search of door
Nails scraped a fine-line 

Jordan moved Todd away

Jordan worked at spot
Tool a thin steel-bar

Ben jolted bullshit

'How do you manage

'To get that
'Thru entry-clearance

Jordan's eyes lit in smirk
He put bar to each face

lines & numbers

Todd replied
Half-convinced

'Security really believes
'You use that as a ruler

Jordan laughed

'Its more believable
'In its bag 

'Next to pencils & calculator

Bar peeled-paint
Revealed a metal door

2ft above-the-ground 
3ft high-&-wide

Jordan turnt-for-real

'she-he-it mugs

'Caught back here
'Gonna be us
'screaming

Jordan truth-stare

'Think some 
'rag-hoe
'Next period 

'Hear our screams

'Gonna do
'same for us

'yall trip

'Best-recognize

'Git all-in
'Right from start

Jordan's bar pat-on-palm 
Confident smacks upon meaty hands

Todd snatched bar from Jordan

'Maybe I should
'Hold onto it

Jordan only 
Looked at his hands
Betrayed 

Swift & sure 
Todd's action

Jordan raised an eyebrow

Content for Todd
To finish the work

All helped pry hinges
Into creaked-submission

Todd always knew
Tunnel went down

Now he saw
Into black-depths

Door had lock
On the inside

Lock fell down 
Distant clangs
Till forgotten

Jordan marked clangs
By ticks on fingers

Jordan let out
Down the shaft

'Pilgrims paranoid muthrfkrs

Ben behind spoke 

'Wouldn't you be

Jordan smirked back

'be? 

~I art worse

'My locks bend
'But they never
'break-ta-bitch

Todd didn't know
How to place the remark

Unsure if Jordan
Full of the shit
Slang proudly promised
_

Dark musty air 
Flowed immediately
To them & up

gust-strong-as-off-gulf
Hot as furnace vent

Something caught Todd's eye
He poked at it with the bar

Elevator-cords
Hung mid
Hidden by darkness

Exchange of glances 
Agreed compliance

Jordan looked casual
Ben would not back down

Moment historic-action
Favorite verse now herald

Todd sung out

'Reach out both-hands
'& Commit

Todd reached with extended-arm 
Grasped the cord both-hands-exact

Todd let himself
Be drawn into darkness

Last sight in confident-smirk
He was prepared for this

Todd fell to the deep
Unstoppable-slide down

!!! HAILMARYFULLOFGRACE
_

All dark
Distance only abstract 

Movement only testified
by-burn-of-palms

Sweat-sprung
will-alone
fought-for-life

Unable to grasp
Frictionless cord

Skin yeilded to muscles
Todd ventured legs out
Till stop at near splits

~thank-the-father
Faithful morning-prayers 

Other two screamed breathless 
Unable to voice
Plain truth of moment

Todd looked up at the door
Only a smudge of silver
Against infinite dark space

! IM GOOD 
! IM OKAY 

! THERE IS OIL
! ON THE CORDS

! SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED

Jordan compulsed

! DERP

Levity lighted mood

Todd not ready 
For a chuckle

'Gonna take off shirt
'Use it
'wrap for hands

Ben asked without idea
How to back up the offer

'Do you need help up

Todd fearless
Began climb

'Best only
'One person

'Be on cords
'same time

'Gonna try
'Find a door

'Fell pretty far
'I guess up

Cool protection of shirt

Skin-peel-palms
Grateful-past-pain

Best course 
Climb up slowly

Important to ensure
Up was possible

Todd's feet
Felt for a door

He spat out old-oil
Iron-tainted saliva

Slide down
Cleared most oil

Covered-hands kept
Clean purchase

Only sounds

Labored breath 
Swells-of-air

Gusts came intense
Risen heat from depths

Wet of sweat
Sprung from pain
Set skin sensitive 

Cool gust tingled stomach
Todd found the spot again

Side-ways ventilation

Todd stomped around
For a door

! TWANG
! TWANG

A light beam
Bore into darkness

'I think

! I found it

One hand felt for handle
It grasped cold metal 

Todd pulled himself higher
Heel put to the handle

!! POMP
!! POMP

Door gave way

Todd pulled himself inside
End of dusty grey hallway

'Im off the cords
'Come down

Todd shouted in best-whisper

'Wrap your shirt
'Around your hands

'I will be here
'To grab you
'if you need it

Jordan challenged

'Stay back

'Something get loose
'Fall onto your face

Ben followed Jordan down
Swift-entry-rewarded scraped-knee

Ben stood up
Saw Todd

shriek-back-sat-ass

! FUCK

Todd covered over
dust-caked 
dark-blood-mud

Blood not oil
Coated the cords

Smears left
Where Todd
Touched himself

Jordan had not
Taken notice 
_

Silver of the dust
Repeated available light

Forward in the cautious
manner of adventure

Basement level an abandoned
Fully-equipped-hospital 

All as-if
Unexpectedly sealed

Electricity on

Emergency-signs
Gave enough light
To move secure

Jordan whispered

'move & pause
'think first

Jordan in front
Hand up
For them to stop

Jordan crouched down
Motioned other two low

'look at floor

'each movement leaves 
'time-stamped direction

Cross-roads of halls
Next to a room

Jordan traced out
Different levels of dust-layers

'look close 

'main hall 
'thinned-down

'elevator shaft hall
'obvious diff

'now the room
'no traffic 

'exact days unknown

'only a relative 
'difference in traffic 

Both caught in admiration 
Jordan not surprised

'Read the floor
'Care each step
_

Inside the room 
An overturnt bed

A familiar form 
Lay half-sprawled

Ben entered
Drew down a corner-blanket

Dust-weighted blanket
Fell off exposed a husk-corpse

Sweet smells
Stung their noses

! twang

Sound came far off

Ben recoiled back
Flipped a metalic bedpan

Long-since dried-up 
Urine & fecal matter
Cloud covered all 

All froze to simple-horror 
Death expectated
At so great a flop

Ben's face
shame & apology


Main hall echoed meaty wacks
Each near shit-themselves

! bap
! bap bap

Distant defiant cry
Gurggled into silence

! aaaahhrrrrr
! eeekkkaahhggggggggggggg

Jordan herded all 
Into the room

Each took blanket corner
Flung remaining dust over hallway

Settled-dust proved
It a poor attempt

Boys could only wait
Huddled in the room
Corpse for company

Green of the blanket
Stained silver of dust

Sweet-smell lost
Day had long-since
Numbed nostrils

Time passed 
Todd braved a whisper 

'shaft went past
'length of two floors

A question
None able to answer

Jordan spoke 

'uni dumps body-parts

'wha-da-fk-right

'Nor much sense
'Secret hospital basement

'mid-evil sex-dungeon
'where-bad-kids
'get-krumpus

'that would
'ease my sanity

Todd agreed

Obvious fact full-face

Someone trapped & beaten
In concealed sub-basement
Underneath Driscol

Authorities no-doubt
Do likewise 
To trio of boys

Boys huddled in a room
Abandoned-level a hosptial

Layers from escape
An elevator shaft
Only known exit

Jordan expert
To such situations

Mousecraft
Sure-ways
To go about 
Circumstance

Patience & long-waiting
Till absolute vacancy established

Period-bells still faintly-heard
They waited for an entire period

Silent in meditation
Self-control not to
Strangle Ben silent

Accept drastic turn
Of Friday morn

Prepare heart to 
Decide upon actions 
With dire-consequences

Eyes & senses 
Well-accustomed 

Direction towards center
Via main-hallway

Main-hall circled
Outside & inner 
Arrays-of-rooms

All watched
For signs of
Frequented-areas 

No fresh treads
Man-made

Jordan led them
On a daily path

One head-of-path
Led to stairwells

They followed other-head
Towards a double-door-room

Daily-path to entrance
Fresh all could tell

Todd & Ben hung back
Jordan looked thru a crack

No movement

Jordan motioned
Others to follow

Trio entered
Auditorium

Stairs descended
Into deep arena

Workstations arrayed 
Each level mirror-stratus

Arrays of setups
Different function

Industrial-lamp 
Draped over stone-table

Embedded shiny-rungs 
Glinted steel 
Restraint-ports

Under each table
Various shelves
Various instruments

Jordan's heart fainted

All the tools
Down all the rows
Polished from recent-use

Fresh path led to
Table center-stage
Light alone lit

nude-red-headed-girl
Strapped to the table
By a broad-leather-belt

So bruised her face
Impossible to see freckles

Freckles covered
Her entire body

Freckled to the point 
Tho bloody, bruised & nude

Freckles the first characteristic noticed
Infinite constellations of cherry-colored-dots

Stitch-patch-closures
Covered her torso 

Patches appeared
Similar fashion
All over her body

Girl's shut-eyes 
Sprang into maniacal-alertness

Two large yellow-orbs
Lit by fierce-fire

Three boys
Not monsters
Stood over her

Jordan busy but unable
To free leather-strap

'How do we get it loose

After no response
Yet exhausted of ideas

Confused past-exasperated
Jordan spoke square-on her

'How

!daFKget

'god-damn-straps

!off

Idiotically loud 

Boys behind dumb-deer 
Timid  & horror
Intertwined hormones

Jordan tilted hard
Girl who screamed earlier
Now kept silent
Not a peep
To save her ginger-ass

Girl pushed opened her mouth
out-wide-display

A mutilated
Stump-of-tongue
In a fuck-you-wag

Stump freshly seared
Gleamed odd-gooish-sealant

A small muffled voice 
Finally came to fullness

'Finally sorry
'I could not speak

'Hardly-breathe
'When Jewels
'This bitch here
'Lays like that

Voice became more clear
Yet kept small

! Jewels

'Dont move like
'God-less neanderthal

'I need to get ready
'To introduce us

Statement excentuated by
Flash & rapt of rod

Source & emission
Too fast to catch

'A hundred years
'Will teach you 
'Patience bitch

'Think 
'I dont know 
'What you are doing

Statements sung out derranged

Infantile hands forced
Way out of a tangle of hair

A creature
Emerged from Jewel's shoulder

A shrunken-head
drawn-back-in-smile

Two baby-arms attached
Under shriveled-ears 

Monster bowed in curtsie
Long-white-bearded

Trio aghast
A monster
Perched on 
Jewels shoulder

Little head
Shortly indignant

'Yes
'I am female
'AND
'This is a beard

'This is
'A shock

'Ignorance like a zit
'Must be popt off

'Beards at my age 
'More elegant
'As the French say

Jewels cast face
Side-ways-ashamed

Nude & openly disfigured
Took over Jewels

Predicament as most-painful

Little head squeaked 
Small-exasperated-sound

'How are you
'Such a cunt
'All the time

Baby hands flailed
Rod at boys

'You expect these
'shrimp-dick-twirps 

'To keep shit

'While you 
'cry-baby-bitch
'About yours

? hhhmmmmp

'I can find
'You a new-tongue

'I can find
'A longer one

'if-you-are-into-that

'This is no problem

'Look at me

'Its a small issue

'You had much worse

'Now no need
'To disrespect me

Monster turned again in bow
Little head tilted

'Miss Countess of First Order

Jordan leant in
Between the two

'for-fks-sake
'we-gotta-skat

Miss paused
Danced rod
Idly in the air

'oh-so-tempted

'The bands
'Are one leather belt

'Hurry up

'There is not

'A

'Second to spare

'Above our head
'Release it there

'Come on rodent-shit
'Not a moment to lose 

Miss content more the boys
Struggled to loosen the band

Miss continued 
queen-of-england

'Jewels can't speak now
'& I can't read her mind

'But I can sense
'What she feels

'Its pure absurd

'She feels
'Ashamed of me right now

'Miss the god-damn
'COUNTESS of Prime Order

Puppeted-head
Trailed on
_

Jordan found the clasp
To be odd-shaped

Only after ingenuity

Only with the help
Of metal bar & 6 arms

Leather-band finally
Slack-release

Jordan's shirt
Least dirty

Jewels wore it
As a small dress

Miss first-priority
Tailor shirt with
Measurement & cut

Demeanor of Miss
Masterful spell over truth

Put the boys to interact
With Miss as to-an-adult

Ben's shoes 
Didn't fit Jewels
Only his socks

Miss rapped Ben
Who knelt relacing shoes

Rod extended to a painful twang
Resonated in his skull

Miss justified the abuse

'We need to hurry
'If they come back soon

'Well each one of us
'Will be strapped again
'All the worse for let

Promptly they made exodus
Out the devilish auditorium

Light had a cruel
elderly-tint-of-aged-desperation
Rays followed in haunting-fashion
as-if-pointing-direction
Vengeful
What themselves had accepted 
Must be fated-true unto-all
_

Elevator cord
Clean enough to allow quick-access
Back up to basement

Not till arrival at closet door
They recognized the predicament

Todd smeared all over in blood
Thin-streams ran down his face
Streaked like bloody-tears

Jordan shirtless
Odd-shaped-belly
Buldged-out

Ben caked in dust
From time under blanket

Less-least-of-all
Jewels & Miss
_

Todd admitted despair

~how-in

!hells-good-grace

'we get out of school

'They are going to know 
'Imediately
'Where we have been

Todd howled passionately

'Put us back
'Down there
'At all costs

Jordan wailed back

! YEAHIT

'They will only say
'Just another god-damn-drill

'Shit happens

! like every couple-months

Ben opened the closet door
Walked into school hall

'Follow me

Five freakish forms
Moved together

Obvious & entrapt
Basement of school

Driscol made global-statistics
Centuries of protocol lock-down

Ben with route of exit
Previously tried at night

Dusty
Shirtless
Pantless
Bloody

Krew of five 
Broke into hall
Cast from horror

Outlandish wraiths sharply-outlined
Against monotony-of-normal-scenes

End of the hall

A teacher stopped her lecture
She opened the door and yelled

!!! MONITOR
!!! MONITOR SECTION 7

!!! 459

Screech a call
For all who heard
To plaster
Against hall-windows
Only a limited-section 

Mosh-pits of greedy-kids
Starved for 1st-hand-account 

Marinated in day-dreams
Reveled from earlier shit-show

Several girls touted
Hideous description
Of the infamous toliet
Ben had obliterated 

Main attraction
A relic in cathedral

Girls recounted impression
Testimony of magnificence

Always to curious
Gatherings of teachers & students

Hour after launch-meal-meds 
full-swing

downers flipped uppers
Accumulated to trigger
Each young-heart feral

Five phantasms
Spectated only
By larger-classmates
Lords of the mosh pits

Teachers in this way
Barred from executing
Proper protocol in true manner
_

Ben led them 
Around corner 
To rush up stairwell

Two large Monitors
Locked-down-in-protocol
Main-exit sentinels

!!! MONITORS
!!! SECTION 1

!!! 459

Both voices boomed

Ben already
Passed down hall

Turnt across level
Towards north-stairwell

Plan superficially
Proved Ben's plan a fail

Aura told a confidence
Never-the-less
Relied on whole-heart

No time to explain
Only for Ben to choose
Rest to follow

Cross the school
In this method

All Monitors drawn
Wrong location

Ben's exit
Higher-up school-levels

Not at ground-floor
As expected

Plan stewed & familiarized
Till such sure-strategy
Only inevitable in circumstance
_

Every window filled
Every door blocked

Curious-children
Stirred by shouts

Starved-of-sights 
Charged by eventful-day

Teachers more scared
The fight-pits
Than to do duty

Krew on such wings 
Arrived second-floor
Unhindered
_

Jordan pulled out
His metal-bar

'Now is the reckoning
'Suggest yall 

'Wake-up likewise

They passed
Restroom of the morn

Towards the window
At end of the hall

Ben took a key
Out his pocket

Ben unlocked  window
With a key fished
Out his pocket

'Go
'Where I go

Each climbed outside
Life supported by narrow-ledge

Sun shone hot
Burned deeper exhaustion

Four-odd-bodies
Outside second-story

World outside
Too-busy-with-day to notice

Ledge continued to a space
Crossed over
Via high-branched tree

Branch over-hung onto the roof
In an entangled attachment

Accessed adjacent roof 
One-floor-drop
_

Onward into alleys 
Towards less-traveled roads

Each of the boys
Knew how to pass-this-area 
Without-being-seen
Ran tired 
Now final-stage their-turf

Familiar with which fences led where
Up which buildings to what

Jewels only had a large shirt
& Ben's sweaty socks

Ben carried Jewels piggy-back
Intervals he could

Headed by Jordan
Other two at her side

Jewels kept covered

Large-city-bustlers
Continued their way without heed
_

Edge of Downtown
Outskirts industrial-sector

Jordan turned into an alley
& Thru a hole
In chain-linked-fence

Hole loosed
Then bound back

Quick-entrance 
Thru unlocked-window

Edifice dusty as sub-basement

Each cautiously 
Followed Jordan's movements

board-to-board-hops
foot-prints exact-over

Trace with few tracks
Up the stairs to a room

Derelict office building
Once a newspaper printery

Newspapers stacked
Columnar dusty-heaps

To a end of hall office
A chain locked
Relocked from inside 

Jordan pushed away cabinet
Hidden behind
Another chain-locked door

'This far from anyone
'Gotta be triple-sure

Lost expressions asked
Jordan answered

'So as to sleep

'Break thru one of these

'Loud enough 
'Wake whatever sleep
_

Cardboard tatmi
Layered floor neatly

Room open & spacious

An outside window
Exposed the endless ocean

Dust free
Ocean breeze

Jordan led them
Thru outside window

A Fire-escape
Covered by patched-tarps

Floor netted-metal
Escape rope coiled
To a corner

Jordan pointed up

'Got a 
'tank-o-rain-water

'Open dis spout
'& Close it
'Wit dat knob

Jordan motioned them
To turn around & leave

'Aint clear-water

'But cleaner than you

Busy in brisk wash

Water well-heated-by-sun
Water splashed far below

Jewels & Miss to their-self
Front the window
Content with bayside view

Endless ocean to right
Left held iconic skyline

Fresh air
Grateful lungs

Peace long-lost
Found in abundance
_

Todd in shower

Ben & Jordan
Laid out on tatami

Ben asked Jordan

'What is this place

Jordan looked-down
Face instant-blush


'This is one
'Of the places
'I live
_

Japanese-tatami well-made
Comfortable-firm-support

Refreshed from shower
Completely exhausted

Ocean gusts massaged
Tense bodies over-whelmed

All passed-out-till-next-morn

Safe slumbers soothed by
Sounds of steady-waves
_

All woke
In daze of a new life

Jordan fed breakfast 
Dried fruit & granola

Chased-down with 
Mtn-Dew Code-Red

Jordan explained
cats-out-of-bag

'Got locations like this
'City-wide

'I can go any where
'In all of Corpus

'Find myself alright
'In an hour

'Tho this one
'Most clean by large-margin

'Each has stash
'All a legit-kid needs

Jordan closed food-container 
Stashed back in closet

'Last week 
'I got stuck across town

'Food there 
'Must have went bad

'Too exhausted 
'To remember eating

Jordan finished apologetic

Childish traumna 
Lost against day
_

Ben realized 
His predicament

! dagon-damn-it

Father sure-cocked
Several self-righteous-strikes

Wallow till enacted drunken
Relish of technique

Ben must soon
Get to a phone

Saturday-morn
From Friday-morn
Till now

A trance finally woken

Jordan had a rummage-of-clothes 
Raided from the downtown charity

Jewels head-to-toe with garments
Most fit-all-too-well

Hiking-sandals
Wool stockings

Light-blue
Summer-dress 

only-a-little-too-short

Her & Miss
Tailored outfit in silence

Repurposed-stockings
For her forearms

Jewels very-sensitive

Miss always held a
Finely-made
Extendable-umbrella

Quick to bar anyone
Seeing what was
Quick-to-hide

Jordan wore
Pocketed vest

Ben tied an old-leather-jacket
In a roll under his military-pack

Todd hands raw
After morn recleaning

Protected in set
Of thick-green wool-gloves

_

Jordan spoke last-chance

'Take everythang

'I never go
'Same place

'In same week

Jordan trailed exit
To cover tracks 

Ben needed to get
To the pay-phone

Nearest phone booth
Lower-district Circle-K

Day warming to be hot
Downtown traffic languid

Heat relaxed 
Overworked-muscles

Warmed from 
Prolonged-stiff-sleep

Ben looked at Todd

'Only enough
'For one call

'You mind
'Can I use it

Todd complied

'My parents wouldn't know
'If I was gone for a week
'I am the last of the litter

Pressing pace of life pushed
Jewels & Miss to be sorted out
_

After 4 unanswered-attempts
Ben tried the oldman next-door

Old voice responded

'Heeh Hello

Ben spoke up loud

'Mr. Grinvix
'This is Ben

After no-response came
Ben spoke louder

'I just
'Wanted to call

'To ask

'If you see my dad
'Tell him 

'On my way home

Still only silence
Ben continued awkward

'He wont answer
'When I call home

Ben waited awkward
Only the sound
heavy-breathing

Old man finally spoke

'Your dad
'is dead boy

'Best get to the authorities
'Have em tell ya

Voice sympathetic
Immediately hung up

Ben stood silent
Phone left to ear

Flabbergasted 

Truth-revealed-lie

Dad always dependable
Now flat lie

Father a jackass
Who tried hard
To keep a light-heart

A man regretful
Life of a father
Stuck with a son

Man enough
Power thru the hardship

Too-often-than-not
Himself the cause

Hero & Villain

Never-again to hit him
Nor give advice
No other could

Ben physically-worked
To come-to-grips

Understandings toppled-down
Dazed among rubble

Four in silence 
Left Ben space to wail
_

A police car
Silently snuck up
Behind them 

Lights now bright
At their backs

!!! PLUUPP
!!! PLUPPP

Cop cut short 

'Alright you juuhhhh

Krew immediately bolted

Cop turnt to fumble open
Door-preemptively shut

Cop let out a curse

Today not a mood 

'Im gonna bust diaphrams
'fkn-lil-shit-fks

Cop called
Thru shoulder-piece

'Broc here

'I got a 281
'On that Driscol 459

'Update the 459
'Now a 499

'Broc out

Cop reversed
Sirens blared

Actuator of the law
Of this here land
Far past eye could see

Official level 9 code
Empowered the cop 

Perpetrators
Better dead

Focus-as-predator
Never dropt target

In that negligence
Cop would greet fate

Over-worked-trucker
Backed by near a ton of Coca-Colas
Took the collision 
As mere mis-direct of
Full- momentum

Police vehicle
Snatched by hawk
Hawk light a frieght-train

Caught in flash
Death talons grip

Unstoppable mountain
Till back wall of 
Circle-K 

Flesh crunched
In sharp folds of metal

Dorito-chips
Soaked soggy like salsa

Cop drowned
A cold-death of 
Mtn-Dew-Baja Slurpee
_

Todd looked back in relief

Police the result of 
Ben's call no-doubt

Timing of cop 
Put it dispatched
From Downtown-Station

Todd pathed krew
Back way Northside

City knew their identities 
Placed to ambush them

North-side an area
Even police feared


Questions caught Todd's throat
Grateful of the many
Many more steps 
Still to take before an answer

Todd led exhausted group
Up hills towards his home 

Ben learnt of father's death
Krew jumped by a now-dead cop

Ben kept black-cloud 
Group kept silence 

If death of Ben's dad
Related to yesterday

It would soon be known 

Horizon closer
With each step
Familiar-landmark

Silence prepares
Way with comtemplation

Deep sleep of night prior
Swept away traceless 

Entreched in labor
No timely aliviation

Acceptance of pain 
as-state-of-being

Five-miles
Drew two-hours time

Under sun unabated 
Top cloudless sky

Gulls squaked enjoyment
Uncomfortable-position of beings
Which gulls envied

Tables turnt to birds favor
Action toilsome for humans
A lesiure for their kind

World continued careless inside cars
Disconnected from momentary-coordinates
Distracted by thoughts of destinations

Five souls suffered 
Unable to begin to voice 
matters-at-hand

Full-capacity 
Under load of present journey

Up hills 
Loomed over costal bay

Favoring sidewalks
Under more shade

Normal world betrayed
As an alien-state

Group fused to
Throes of turmoil
_

Miss broke silence 
Stood up full-height

Unfurled-umbrella
To take stage

All bored watching
Jewels proded to 
Walk in front

'I am Miss
'Countess of Prime Order

'We have
'Not formly met

She let her voice sink in
Rested afirmation uncontested

'I already know your names
'No need to introduce again

Her finest white gloves
Covered the baby-hands

Irritated Miss continued

'Tho it would be
'Polite

Communication took time to digest
After the miles of misery

Miss 
only-by-obvious-concious-effort
Paitent & merciful continued

'I have been attached
'By surgical-operation
'To this beautiful woman 

'Jewels

Miss pat ginger-head
With furled-rod

'Jewels offered to the Order
'The Esoteric Order of Dagon

'Jewels
'Child of a wealthy family

'Prime offfered
'Price of family 
'To enter order

'Truthful this binding
'An honor not a curse

'To introduce Dagon
'To the unanointed

'Oath-breaking death-sentence

Jordan smirked an interruption

'Everyone knows Dagons Eve

Miss irked challenged

'Dim

'Wit

'Then explain Dagon 
'In one paragraph

Jordan realized
Concept of Dagon 
An empty pinata

Miss amused continued 

'I have
'Favor of the Seer

'So I may
'Do as I please
'Keeping-oathsworn

Miss set down the umbrella
Under shade of long-line of trees

Able to focus more
Energy on explainations

Sure of what was
Qnly question to Todd

Only able to derail
Sorrow for this short-time

'Dagon is a cosmic god
'Infathomable & Unsaitable

'Earth is bribed to Dagon 
'As an occult offering 

'A sacrifice of this world
'& All worlds connected
'By Quantum-Entanglement

'All existences after our image

'In exchange for divine bounty
'Past imaginations which gods bestow

'All Earth consumed
'Drained dry as Mars

'Blessings of 
'Omnipotent-powers-uncalculable 

'Some envision

'The gift of infinite-life
'Indesuptably
'To be as god themself

'I am one of those
'In faith of Dagon

'All worth
'Exchange of 
'God's blessing

'I am 400 years old
'But only a year
'As symbiotic with Jewels

'Don't be fooled 
'I offer much to her

'I heal her & repair her
'Surgeon centries-in-experience

'I guarntee her
'Life till old age
'Lived in wise counsel

'I know my
'Place as passanger

'Tho admited
'Method hard 
'At first to see

When Miss traveled
To other parts of body
She burrowed

A fleshly-lump
Size of a small-ball
oved in collapseable
Tunnel under skin 

Right shoulder her perch 
Baby-arms held the umbrella
When not busy describing words

Entire puppet folded-up
Tucked into a small-hump

'Jewels bequeathed divine-microbials

'Bowels of Dagon
'Digestion of the gods

'As old woman
'Event of the Asteroid
'Followed thru 
'Tales of Eastern-Monks
'Who under-tourture
'Guided our Order
'To a prophetized
'Mountain-village
'Prophecy built upon
'Ancient astrology and
'Deep-cosmic-mathematics 

'Our mission could not compromise
'Nor be halted by mercy for ignorants 
'Myself mamed in the adventure

Miss trailed off
Lost in that last statement

'Decades
'Mining the asteroid
'Broke unprecedented discoveries

'Asteroid contained
'A hallowed gift

'Mound-of-Excrement
'Of the god Dagon 

~holy-be-it
~eternally

Miss completed handsign

'Sadly only
'This small mass
'Of me left
'When bateria-microbials 
'adjusted to our host form

'Microbials refine 
'All ingestion & assimilation 

'Bacteria sentient
'Of the well-being
'Of host as life-itself

'Jewels is stronger
'Than all you boys combined
_

Krew kept to street-sides
With most shade & least people

Day burned all pink

Miss spooke tween gusts
Gusts drowned out her voice

Perked-of-interest
They walked together

'Jewels
'Owes The Order much 

'But she is
'A foolish girl

'Gets

'Youthful emotions 

Miss lost in turmoil
Slid to more
Resentful-tones

'Yes 

'Jewels is foolish

'Myself always busy 

'Patch'n up
'What she self-inflicts

Jewels back-handed Miss

! WACK


Miss mumbled
Sorrowfully quiet

For a time
Stopt under shade

far-end-corner
over-grown-lot

Under Willow shade
Miss stitched puppet-parts
back together

Long thin roll tabbacco
Miss needed help to concentrate
_

After a few blocks 
Miss regained full-compsure
Center of stage again

'I have stood
'Front adored thousands
'Back when those numbers
'incaculable for human mind

'Stand before you honest
'Sympatheic to Jewels 

'Single wish to be 
'un-upgraded to next-level
'modulal fashions

'Order demanded such sacriledge amended
'Operation to finalize this morn 

'Jewels
'Much more than an offering

'Jewels guided the universe
'To that Eden of optomized position
'Proof of it borne on skin

'Name annointed Jewels by Seer 
'Singular treasure of the cult

'Freckles on her body
'aun as baby
'Necessary waypoints

'deep-cosmic-function
'map to a universe
'Quantum possibility
'Aligned towards
'Everlasting-happiness

Keystone to the Order

'All consumed lost to Dagon
'Remade by mathematic laws witch
'Govern Quantum Entanglement

'One is because of all
'Existence of one
'Will force all 
'To exist in that realm

'friends enemies ancestors

'All remade as phoenix
'Each remade as best-self 

Jordan braved the silence

'best is relative

What Jordan feared
Hit him with a twang that sang
Tunes in religious over-tones

Miss never more pleased
Detracted the rod 
Back into a cane

'Order will seek her out
'Because she is this map 
'Dagon will be required
'To read this before summons

'Many sure Dagon 
'Just as easy read
'skin-even-as-leather

Miss let that sink in
Failure now likely 
Restricted Jewels to
That single fate

Ben braved question at Miss

'Why work to keep
'Jewels out of the Order

Miss expected such 
Smart over-simplifications

'Fate will bear
'All to pass

'If reaching Eden possible
'In any possibilty

'It will happen
'Due to its her-own-flow
'That is my faith 

'Faith impossible
'For youth to comprehend

Todd defended

'I have faith

Miss chuckled

'Innocent of youth
'Faith is a seed
'Nurtured by decades
'Fertile from blood
'Ones own & many-others

'Only by boon of Dagon
'Can humanity reach
'Reality promised by Jewels

'If Jewels skin
'Lost to the Order
'Means the end
'Of this most-unique possibility

'Many rightley-reveer
'To keep this course
'Command from God

'No sacrifice too great

'Power currents
'Have drawn Jewels
'First to wealth
'Then to The Order
'Now to you

Jewels ginger hair
Caught the beams of sun
Auroa an amber glow

Royal beauty
No patchwork possible mar

Miss continued

'Only one of our 
'Entangeled-Possibilities
'Needs reach that destination

'Fate the power
'Which will drag
'All divergencies to
'Realign perfect-trajectory

'Power of Fate
'Future results
'Of prior actions
'Change the past

'Sacrifice of all
'As payment for all
'To attain a more perfect existence

Commerical zones
Faded to residential-streets

Schools, graveyards & empty-lots

Miss stayed herself a while 
Not easy for Miss to talk
While Jewels walked 

Truth of the present
Best met upon
Proper context of the past
Right perspective of purpose

'The Seer secretly entitled me
'Follow paths by accordance to Jewels

'Force of whole-cult 
'Too much for any to stop 

'Someone of her imporance
'Need improve as insurance

'Every day
'New demands

'Till only one answer satisfy

'Jordan woke us that morn 

'Providence gathered all 
'To rescue us
'Out unbreachable-system 

'Knights & heroes
'Pale to the deeds 
'Which you 
'Yesterday fulfilled

'All only at the cost
'Of only half a tongue

Sun hot
Hours after noon

Lights on
In Todd's house

Todd burst inside
Heart-in-throat

Lights on meant
All was right 

Parents were alive
Or they would 
Be dead by now
Then who would
Turn on the lights

Eyes readjusted
To indoor light

Only after noticed
Smell of outside
Inside the house 

Glass of broken windows
Shattered under his shoes

Leaves whipped-up
Under family-portraits

Forms of countless-cats
At once made out
Infesting every shadow

First one then countless
Embattled-hiss

Felines sprang convexed
Launched-agression

A large Calaco
First charged Todd 

Large muscles
Buldged tense

Todd had two-smarts
Half-thought quicker
With a kick & a snatch

Each of his siblings
Loved to have cats
But hated to discipline them

Todd enjoys discipline
A pack of mangey-cunts

Cats stopped the attack
As if hit invisible wall

None cared to risk
Same demise of leader

Calaco goolike-mash-upon-clean-walls
Act duplicated over & over 

Fresh pulp of steamy meat
Arose any kitty to salivate
So exquistely-rare the patee 

Despite quelled-up 
Great fear of the rampage 

Several stopped
For a quick-lick

Felines swarmed 
Over a form
On the maternal bed

Most of the body chewed
Remnant of his mother

Obeese from an accident
Father stayed true decades after

Todd began to vomit
Habitual direction
Into restroom


Huched-face-first-ass-out
Across the toilet
Past-prime-pickings
Now only a gluttonous-feed 
Mass of his father

Proud man of great zeal 
Now unwanted meat-lump

Todd cleansed the scene of home
Painted by Macabre medium
Fresh after stern-rigtheousness 

Corpses of parents 

Grey puss
Foamed out each
Mutilated orafice
Length of each scratch

No cat-claw could pierce 
Todd's thick wool-gloves
_

Neighbors came out
Bore quick witness
Loathesome scene

Guilty

In fear of the boy
They all betrayed

None with courage
To venture aide

After horrendous
Death of the twins

Two basketball-players
On the way home
Decided to aid shrieks

Returned to the street
Front roused hood

Choked upon 
Puss-filled throats
Dead mid-crawl

Cops removed bodies
Off the streets 
Did not interfere further
_

After the last
Cf the cats

Past tears 

Todd left home
Bathed in warm guts 

Todd used his might
To bust feline belly stretched
Legs-to-legs above his head 

Cats in lunacy 
Avoided the fate
Busy in actions
Which more quickly
Condemened them

Thick wool golves
Perfect for pussy-busting

Raw flesh able to breathe
Yet protected from all-else
_

Cats have 9 lives
But they are their
Own worst-enemy

Cats take too long 
To do everything 

Contemplation
Calculating-actions

Aun to their demise

10s of bodies
Litered the rooms 

Jewels could not walk fast
Unaccustomed to new sandals

Jordan & Ben as-well
Decided to give Todd space 

Near 100 dis-embowled-bodies
Trailed Todd's direction

Over short distance
Cat is quick

Over long distance 
Mankind reigns supreme

Aun to naps
Cats put-off-guard 

Awoken too late
By honey-scent of
Warm gore
Dripping off Todd 

Over-fence
Thru-yard
Along-country-road
Over-cemeteries
Thru-fields

Until finally
Rocky bays of ocean 

Rock-to-rock in hops 
Crashing waves below

Cats moved with agility 
Todd still much faster

Todd climbed next & next 
Till at an island

Todd hopped to shore
Birthed in gore 

Thicket-walled-island
Only one entry

Twisted narrow-tunnel
Opened up to vast expanse 

Antiquated farm-equipment
Animals of a rare variety
Fire-pits with altars 

One solitary hut
Built large as warehouse 
Loomed in the center

Retractable thatched roof
Edifice top lifted-concrete-foundation

Large bonfire-pit
Center of the circular lot 

Cat with the first
Warning-message
Only-just-returned

As if only
To introduce

Todd the Reaper 

Todd entered
Presence of the Witch 

Mess of steaming-minions
Eyes aflame on target
Pupils well-set 
Black-ember of vengance 

Crafty & full-of-guile
Always an old witch

Yet caught uexpected 
Fire-nado torrent of
Youth's blue-flame

Froze her cold-heart
Warm to love of life
Appreciation & need
Aun fear to its continuance

Slow is man
To be slain
Bare-handed
_

When the four
Finally reached the Dunes

Stuck overnight in cemetery
Large moseleum long-since 
Cleansed clean by time

Jordan roasted a few cats
A meat to aide once enemies
Who now pleaded 
Desperate for dinner

/////////////////
// cat DREAM
/////////////////
_

Cats laid outside
A counless ring
Around the center-hut

Too-tired from
Week's events to move

Todd kept to himself
Content to a corner 

Jewels stomached her way
Around the witch's hut

Parts of the witch 
so-scattered-such
She prayed it 
Due-to-hungry cats 

Leatherbound tomes
Laid upon altars
Under attrium

Each attriumy
With bonfire-pit

Great iron-pike
Stood to mount cauldron
_

City out to find them
No where to go but here

Supply of the Witch
Enough to last years

Filtered water piped 
From pond-sized resivoir
Kept lifted & covered
Fed by passing torrents

Firewood came pentiful
Off ocean drifts

Three weeks went by 
With even less words
One to another

Each kept alone 
Busy in own interests 

Each front a different 
Fire-pit of countless

Friendships each with certain animals
Which also called that area home

Animals wild yet mannered
Co-habitation bonds
_

Jewels absorbed herself
Learning the ways of the Witch
Ordained now to life's calling

Weeks in the study of the tomes

Prolonged-deduction
Of state of each pit

Symbols
parts & bowls
mixtures & brews

Miss engineered a
Sheild-like Tome
Bound by iron 

Four-tome
two-wide two-tall

Leather-pages
Made from thin-flesh
Of abundant dead cats
_

Jordan spent time
In exploration 

Situation of the island
Excellent

Built from foundation
To be off-the-grid

Preserved certain utilities
Better than County

Island isolated
Thicket massked

Countless islands identical

Each with small sandy bays

Murky environment
Kept people away

A worn rock cliff
Dropped to deep-ocean-waters 

One leap 
Exfoliated skin deep-cleanse

Sea life
Plentiful & transient

Jordan now satifisfied
Ultimate-desire:
Self-sustenance
Upon fresh meat
Hunted & gathered
By own hands
_

Ben & Todd in similar circumstance
Understood each other
Entirely divergent
Based upon their reactions

A global power
Now aimed to get them
At many costs

Cat-assassins of wiccan conjury
Sent for Todd

Ben's dad murdered
In an unknown way

Price paid
For decisions heavy

Miss sung at night
A voice dusk-gusts carried

'Song of every bay 
'Existence in seasons

'Day after day

'Today is only
'Just another day

Todd & Ben
Well-healed in time

Careful path
Slow healing
_

Ben powered his laptop
At a solar-power-station
Built by the Witch

Todd observed
meditations prayer exercise

Jordan lived in peace
Finally repaid
From long turbid years 

Jewels enshrined Tome
Endowed full-steam

Miss ever diligent
To guide & grow 
Jewels talents
Past abilities
_

Cats avoided Todd
At eyesight
Reveered Todd with gifts
Only as-he-slept

Trophies 
Fearsome-rats
Sharp-tooth-fish
Large-spike crabs

wads-of-money 
gold-chains

Once pack of cats 
confroted Todd boldly

Each cat had scar
Same location hind-leg

All dragged heavily 
A massive religious-piece

An iron-rod
Length of arm

Inlaid igots of gold
Large & heavy
_

Manner of the Witch
Long-since depended on
By animals for normal-life

Responsibility 
Best taught quick

Jewels set as natural god
Wisest cats pampered by love

Guided her how to care for animals
Guided her in ways of the Witch

Wiccan conjury of occult powers
Discovered & tested underneath
Supervision of expert rows of feline-eyes

Thirty minute

Jordan led them
Across parking-lot

Thru adjacent empty-lot
To a tucked-corner-side-tree

Jordan lifted bush-branch
A small path opened

Jordan entered pack-first
Others followed like-wise

After few minutes of crawl

Jordan stopped
Turnt to look at them
His characteristic move
Meant something serious

'I really 
'feel sorry for you

'Trust me
'I do

'But keep bitch-silent
'Hobos are all around

Trail looked to been
Made by a rabbit

Walls too narrow
For an adult

Movements snagged
In unseeable ways

Relentlessness

Near an hour

Rewarded a scathed-body
Open scenes of civility

Canopy thick overhead
French lamp-posts bordered
A grassy pathway which led
To a small-building

All bled

To great bewilderment
Jordan confessed

'I put those thorns

Jordan set them down

'I was much 
'Much bloodier

Small building
Modest-sized utility shed

Miss continued

'This place forgotten
'The years that

'I now remember
'Having walked by it 

'How years

'Two-years after Karma

'Only Univeristy Hospital
'Alone kept open

Ben jolted

'The entire region

Route-tracers only returned 
Bogus information

Bringing focus back
Jordan explained

'My grandpa worked here 

'Several photos of my grampa

'Taken at different
'Parts of this lot

Framed photos
Lined a wall

'He  cut grass
'Up to the street

'I spoke to a librarian
'About the shed

'We researched it a bit

Jordan pointed

Framed paper on the wall
An old schematic 

'Gank dat
'From Library

'Original building-plan
'For the utility shed

'Hardly stealing
'Doing paper a favor

'Better shrine for me
'Than forgotten forever

Six impenetrable walls
Gave all ached-comfort

Makeshift shower
Walled off by a tarp
Hose & drain

Only room no fire

Jordan rationed supplies 
Terrible truth after
Promises till now of gorge

~passage of life
~serious decisions

~who-da-fk-cares

'all would taunt
'back in Jordan's face

Closer to city than Dunes
But only seemingly
Jordan reminded them
Too-detailed of the cost
Which journey paid
_

Jordan started a story
Last to sit in circle

'One night past-midnight
'Stuck this side of town

'Crackhead-muthrfkrs 
'Everywhere like roaches
'Tween here & Industrial

'Normal day-to-day folk
'With night-time-hungers

'Sure at day
'Hobos are timid
'But come night
'They know just 
'As well as you
'They got you
'Alone

'Then
'Hobos front hard

'Till you show
'The peice you got
'To keep your back

'All break no fight
'Like golden ray of day

'Banish bitch out of em
'all in a cold-front storm

'Corpus pleasant bay
'To livid storm
'Within hours

Ben broke in
'Holy fuck 
'You were in that

Jordan continued
'Saw this overgrown log

'4:20am guard out smoked
'Saw me & hollar me inside

'I cried a bit

'He leet me stay
'Till his shift ended

'I ate half his lunch 

'I was so cold
'I drank an entire
'Pot of coffee

'Never could stomach
'The taste before

Jordan's eyes
Wide & loving 

In cherish
Of that time

~yeah-it

'Coffee kept me
'good-spirits 

'Snuck out 
'Utility building-plan
'in-hand

'I needed to find the shed
'For Grandpa's sake

'Hella-turnt-by-caffine

'Circled the lot 
'Found shelter
'Under the tree

'Still too rainy
'To take out schematic

'I sat-a-sec-ta-think
'Behind where hobos
'Store booze bottle
'A Rabbit front path

'It retreated
'Showed the way

'Couldn't stop
'Till I arrived

'Rain didn't 
'Breach the canopy 

'If I tunneled 
'I kept warm
'Dried up eventually

'Rabbits kept
'path distinguishable highway
'Trail-heads always hidden well

'Back that time much easier
'To get thru back-then
'For a motivated kid
'Turnt on pot of coffee

'Some parts brute-forced
'Quarter-mile crawls
'switch-backs-n-shit 

'Shed impossible to find
'Without the schematic 

'I knew I would reach the shed
'Even only four-posts left

'I came upon
'Rabbit kingdom

'You have not seen one
'Since we walked in

'They are all hiding

Miss as spokesman

'I think we could
'Smell

'Hundred of rabbits

Jordan promised

'You will see them
'One day if they
'Find respect in you

Despite Jordan's protest
Ben established a 
Command Center

Which took over
Jordan's weird 
Grandpa-shrine

Ben as promised

A bite of polar difference

Drove all to a mad
Sift thru supplies

Bottle-neck for supplies
Not cost or rarity 
Only the limit of how much
One able to carry thru path

Miss overlooked rummage 
Picked & flung with rod

'Jewels will like those

Items thrown here & there

Remark a tru set up

A steady stubborness
Carried a hopeless-heart

Defeated tho unable
To change course

Boy made hand-signs

'My dog

'I need to find my dog
'Voice is passed to you

Todd suddenly
Distinguished himself

Aware of the
Presence of two

Boy became impatient

Jordan's voice spoke up 
Todd did not sense him

'Dogs logically
'Will gravitate 

'Towards high corners

'There are several
'Under this dome

'There is one there

Dark-black rock-outcrop 
Toward the end of the blade

'Walk to that pocket first

'Loud echoes 
'Will draw you dog

'Each path you make
'Will leave a trace 

'This hack-n-slash tunnel 
'Perfect trail for a dog

Boy looked behind
To the long wide path 
Tunnel truly a clear path

'Your scent
'Carried in
'All this goo 

Nude boy 
Covered in goo

'Not to mention
'You piss every
'Five minutes

'These hot swells of air
'Will get your dog to you

Jordan concluded

'More corners you check
'More opportunites 
'For your dog to 
'Catch your scent
'As you will be high

Unexpected sudden-bloom of hope
Burst joyous epiphany

As a laugh in a quiet-room
Todd severed from the spurt

Todd point of redemption of a powerful line of monks

Two hours left his body exhausted but his mind awakened
Forced & pushed as if drift-wood over tidal
Prayers, contemplation, mantras, readings, writing

Prayers coupled by yoga poses & martial forms

Western praktice of sacrifice hardened an Eastern-core

ost decisions in life have no bearing to 
good, evil nor neutral

Philosohy & sciences oriented his decisions
Always to gravitate to a larger reason

Thru the use of constant & everpresent themes
Todd praktised artes of instant-divination

Tho moments entirely new & relational
Distict endgames laid out apparent doors

Doors high-lighted by halos in a sea of the infinite

Todd noted all their dealings in a record which he kept without fail 
Jewels a diamond in all this 
Her emitted refractions captured & treasured fueled all-else

Passangers in Mecca to reach him
Bestow upon him their gratitude
Enriched by this impoverished idol
_

Adventure returned them always to the city
Flock migrations in tune with the season

Spot to spot to spot
All knew spot destinations


Logs maintained if-seperated
Logs pinged their locations
Eventual only all rejoined

Each had a pack of their core items
Each location had accumulated stashes

There had over-whelming amount
Where here never-had-enough-of
_

iss kept on Jewels to grown her own plants

Power of plant-magik
Unlocked thru engeries of service given to the plant

Sexual-pain in orgasm of the pluck
Never to cut them only guide them with cords

Soil not plentiful at the Dunes
Nor the enviornment kind to plants

Gusts kept all vegitation stunted 
Salt dehydrated all to a hardened bark

assive acres of Texas farmland surround the city
iss sure of some region to sneak a garden

A hidden cultivation of plants with access to irrigation

Harvest moon waned to orange/redish tints
Forgotten & unused acres
Obvious against cultivated lands only-weeks past harvest
_

Friday nights alotted for long-suffering-adventures

Jewels had nurtured month-old-plants
Each nested on the bikes

Friday night on a long ride to the outskirts
Farm-hands & all related just-paid-well-drunk at bars

15 kilometers to arrive at the border
Yet there required a scour

These plants would find home or die
Roots could not sustain a return journey

Jordan welded a hitch for a one-wheel-trailer 
Pimped-position kept his feet outstresched ahead
Riding low against minimal air-resistance

Agitation on the plants unavoidabley to scar them with a sense of insecurity
Roots would grip peaceful-plains with a steadfastness from the experience 
An end to which so much sacrifice had paid

/////////////////////////
// Across town & down roads past horizons
// Each passing truck honked
// Calling them out as stranger: noticed & remebered

// Holligans up to no good
// Plants probably drugs

Hours passed into moonlight

Jewels finally stopped arms out-streched-skyward
Sensing the energy of a wishful-place

iss affirmed with air-of-pride
Umprella compass to her magnetic-pulls

'Yes 
'Deep-water in the air

'Jewel
'You dear gem
'Your ability is second-to-none

Jordan keen to practical-ingenuities
Bikes stashed inside an overgrown-roadside-drainage

Jordan always covered them with a dark tarp
He locked the set with his handy-chain

'Bikes will stamp-down trails too obvious

'Without the bikes
'If we move careful
'Passerbys won't distinguish the foot-path

Always it was 5 lenghts in the a sharp turn one-step-path

10 Acres thru single-file
All infested with dark-red-ticks
 
osquitos & gnats feasted 
Bugs bit at their salty-sweaty-bodies frenzied

Lust of meal perked all more for worse

A small hill loomed in the horizon 
Leakage off the hill made the path difficult

ud caked their shoes till ankles
Shins sliced by serrated-leaves

Jordan pointed at rusted-hinges
A gated hill shut for decades 

Overgrown the gate could only be hurdled

Signs of long-abadonment

An old camp chair next to a rusted-thru-tin-bin 
Decades-old-crushed-beer-cans crunched everywhere

Strewn about odds-that-spoke-of-a-person who kept this place as private-quarters 

iss commented still worn from the journey

'It must have been a miserable-fool 
'To keep this parcel-of-hell a lounge

Jordan said assured of the hill 

'This is definitely manmade

Tho molds of the hill had longsince-become-organic

'Plains-dirt causes this shit-pit

'No cohesion to let the water run smooth

Pack twisted & curved, blazing up overgrowth

Plants thick & greedy for space
Full of things which crawl & bite
Foliage 10-feet-high at places

Path broke to grassy knoll at its summit 
Plateau larger than what-looked-possible-from-below

A dark plane circle lay flush with the ground 

iss had a habit of annoying them with her poetry

'A dark portal  
'Sacred pillar

'Reflection without ripples 
'Harvest-moon bore mirrored

Each soaked the sweat & tourtures of raw flesh
Little fish nibbled away the crusts of skin & ticks

'The architect of th Downtown Memorial
'Once described the difficulty of the process 
'To engineer a water-mirror

'Where his words

'Here is one formed by more than happen-stance 
'Reflection adapts stabalizing to perfect reflection

Wild grass held a lush Kentucky Green, cool & soft 
Blades of it clung as moistured-gauze
Balm on tired, bit & sun-baked-flesh

Two hours past in preparation of the banks 
Four turned the soil with whatever-worked at hand

Removed grass replanted in care
So beautiful the summit vegetation

Jordan retrieved the still-serviceable barbque-pit 
They alloted a section of the bank for the DIAGRAM constructed with washed-pebbles

iss conducted rites over metals, wood, mineral
arijuana dashed over the top
Each hovered over the flames chanting after Miss

Faggots incensed to calm nerves of the roots
Happily-high all enjoyed the moment

rite materials as bed to the roots
Plants carefully enlaid upon pool bank

Dawn broke as all positioned at the DIAGRAM
Taken by sleep upon carpet of Kentucky Green

Todd a plump chinese adorned by the same relic-cross

Chants crept groggy-concious

Unable to capture the words as one grasps smoke

Jewels spoke in firm-beauty
Perked enticingly by the rich-adoration caused by her voice

Prophet adorned by all-fine-things

A tiara laid by fine workmanship 
Fish-bones & pearls worked into gold

She bowed in introduction
otioning boys to stand

'I am the Prophet of La Gatenau

Puff-puff-pass & handsings in synchronized unity

Eyes closed & linked forearms
Chants continued

Wakefulness slow
Entrenched in the chant intelligble due to dryness-of-mouth 

Eyes damned by mucus cracked open by tears-of-agony

Jordan familiar to miserable situations able to get a tarp laid

All put-out & passed-out on-and-off
Unable to sleep-deep thru present-misery

Hunger woke them hours later 
Jewels urged them cautious

Trance lasted two days & nights
Prophet Jewels dealt them great harm 
To wretch them in suffering-unparallel

Winter-months at the Library
A bitter-time of sunless-days under a moist frozen canopy 
Passive to the paths of constant-northern-gusts & frozen-colder by the ice off canopy

Jewels communicated by unmistakable gestures
~ fK-this-damn-stub


Jewels argued with Miss in cabin-fever
iss often only rapt Jewels on the head

Hot but stuffy in a one-room-building
Silent in misery

Jordan spoke up

'Lets go back to the Dunes
'Rather have a few bad days
'Than have all shitty ones

'For-fks-sake

'We all synced to mutual-bowel-clockwork 

'Jewels shits 6am
'Todd always at 7:13
'Ben shits after lunch
'I shit before sleep

Ben snapped back annoyed

'I cant pick up & leave

Keystrokes hammered his mood audible

'Code takes time to set up
'Before I can think of walking away

'We might not come back for a months
'Major pillars of the Undernet based here

Todd pointed out simply & reinforced with suspicion

'We been here over a month

'Aren't you always on about how you can get same access anywhere

Ben got up from the computer tilted
Using his hands to help communicate

'Dude I tell you the same things always
'I am refining mechanics

'But to refine the mechanics in code
'I got to take it apart

'Let me rebuild the modules then we go

Ben had gotten back down to begin typing
After ten minutes passed

'A new drop is coming
'Jewels

He turned toward her
Jewels hissed at him

'Trailer for your bike

Her smile melted all cabin-fever
Happy the rest of her day in merriment

A week required to prep the trailer with all required layers of paint
andatory before Jewels attached it to her bike

Todd jealous of the master of Ben to diffuse the situation

'Well we do need 
~coffee-n-shit
'I will get the drop

Jordan's phrase word all adopted 

Ben resumed his clacks

'Wanted: 1/8 shrooms & lb whole-bean-coffee & jelly-beans

Ben threw an accusative finger at the tatami-mats

'Jordan built those for streching
'Yall need to be busy doing that

'You might not know 
'How you are supposed to 
~Prepare

'But as for me I got a damn-good-idea
'My entire life is culminating into the Undernet 

'Mankind is going to battle with some God
'We have no knowledge of how to beat it

'As Todd says 

~I have faith this trajection
~Fit some necessary role in the end

Jordan added to the situation

'None of my skills are new
'Far as me

Todd ashamed agreed to the same
His strength meditation & contemplation

Six monitors mounted on the wall

Wires of rainbow-sort intertwined them

Ben took a backseat past weary-exhausted
Drank coffee & blunted-up

Green Bull: coffee & blunted-up

echanics of code finnicky & specific
Interfaces must have structural-soundess
Infrastructural network piping industrial-grade

Computer-nodes networked together by homogeneous-unix-kernels
Each tapped into the network on some distributive task

Ben's Undernet launched in desperate soil
A society too long censored

All projected out in a monolithic P2P cloud 

Regions network-packets only analyzed & routed at central

Unix Undernet easily spoof data-packet in end-to-end end-points
$KEY allowed users, leecher, posts

Nodes of most interest had node $KEY of higher value

'Hard to tell when code is mine

Jordan always went first to break wind
Low to ground with low-wind-resistance

Jewels next along hauled the Tome trailer
A massive chain jingled in a coil aside Tome

Todd next with Ben to follow
Fat tires heavy in a long-haul

Nearby school lots all empty
Skaterless lots on a Friday
Only meant one thing

Vacancy meant skaters migrated
Else one or two always be there trick-shit

Ben drenched in sweat & labored approached an old couple walking their dog
Sight of him startled the couple

~hey you seen a bunch of skaters

Old couple only looked back defensively 
Dog in front held in firm protection

Jordan slandered-typically something obscene as they left

Eventually it was discovered
Skaters convexed at an all-invited-house-party

Cleaned up Ben crying-drunk

Old clothes discarded for different clothes

Jordan gave the talk
Each in turn oathed

Four of them left the next day to return with bikes

Krew of 8 could manuever anywhere uncontested

Jordan talked up the Garden
He promised it would be an epic-trip

A large girl named Manda
Two twins named Greg & Steve
Kikochi a Japanese temporary

Kikochi played the flute on Jewels request as they appraoched
Song caught with the breathless sight

A sacred pool in different manners but unmistakable fashions of his heritage

Plants saturated the air in a hum
A great-greenery amassed on the knoll
Polished stones bordered the mirror-pool


Greg asked holding the giant cat

'What does the cat eat while you are gone
'big-ass-bag-of-cat-food

Kikochi struggled to accustomize himself to the fish nibbles

'Creepy

'Makes me feel more natural
'Two organisms in same enviornment help each-other 
'Not exploiting or molesting

Kikochi pointed to his dick

'What you say

'One earlier bit my penis

Jewels splashed his way 

~Ate tick off dick
~you got favor

Fish food experience too creepy for the twins 
They only euro-bathed

Four felt a calling near
Each in a darkened-dread

Jordan started to lecture

'We are going to be in a state

Greg accepted eager to cut off an unnecessary rant

'Yea we got you guys

'spray your face with water
'dont laugh when you shit-all-over

Jordan blushed, his shit always diahreeah

Wrapped in a leaf shell 

'Dagon the dragon

Orbs reflected in the mirrors of her eyes

Seven great oculus-pearls rested upon a bed of vegitation
Two pearls cloudy dark

'Be assured

'What is learnt of this first encounter 
'Must be transmitted to aid all others 

'Image of Dagon
'A clone entity

'Dagon links an Image in each reality 

'If Dagon killed in one reality
'The god will possess the Image of the previous realm

'Infinity upon infinity in chain-link

'If Image of origination destroyed
'That origination is your reality

'Dagon will be naturally afterwards be sealed-over-time
'Exterminated as possibilities gravitate to the successor

'Lot fated to fail 
'Learn to survive

Jordan taunted her after she came-back-up

'Our reality will be destroyed
'Others will likely forsee it

'How do we sync to them

Jordan inturrupted

'Streets will always have symbols
'Like grafiti or flags

iss added 

'Agreed that is wise
'We must each await this

'Symbol of the Gates
'This the Crest of our Pact

Todd added disappointed

'Join up with a movement
'Rather than start our own

'A humble but necessary route

Ben tossed in

'Our mission is to survive

'Ground-zero will be the most logical safe-zone
'Here we set up a gate to enter & strike the Order

Jewels signed

~Eye-of-the-hurricane 
~Or nuke-city
~I say 50/50

Ben continued

'Image must be secure
'Near the portal will need to be a stable
'To them it would be secure one place

Todd joined

'One area to scout
'Pass info to the realms that will be hit

Ben continued

'Presence on the inside 
'Some world power may be found
'This group to enable us

iss finalized

'Gate way to the heart the Uni

iss turnt to Todd

'Will that window work twice

Todd smirked cockily

'I had it checked legit

'When I ran away the first time I found the passage
'I snatched the key random 

Ben ended

'Why go thru years of chanting
'To give out a hopeless warning

'All-ever passed-in-this-existence 
'Consumed as meal for one-being-alone

Jordan looked up

'Nests-hella-infest 
'Always centers a fat-bitch-queen 

'We know the school 
~three-god-forsaken-years

'Who over us 
'best to break-in to the Uni

'Todd you still got the window key

All agreed

Jordan lit up excited

Gaze up in the sky arms-outstreched 
Crying out in circles

! Finally 
! Xena 
! in-arms-soon

Each with  creepy-experience
When they learnt that about Jordan

anda looked around confused

? Xena

Jewels turned her to herself
~stuffed-giant-panda
~used-for-humping 

Ben filled int 
'left in Jordans locker 

Jewels rode the air giving winks at Jordan

Jordan shot out

'Hey dont steal attention from out moment
'Xena is the perfect companion

The invisible bear threw her down to ride her stallion

Jordan smiled

'Hey our kind has pride
'Xena is only inanimate to those 
'Who don't show her love first

'You know kinda like a cat

Jewels stuck confused at the truth
_

Ben frequently rambled-on as he hacked away on puter
Night-times best for dark-terminals & batteries

'Regional network routed thru University Hospital 
'One key likely existed as a backdoor to all traffic 

'Any pattern would betray itself eventually

'Birthday-coincidence-proof is strong
'Cleverness helps quite a bit


anda opened an adoration

'Ben global 1337 hacker

'Damn-son kill-it yo

Jordan caught it

'ttttahh
'I never say kill-it

Ben continued

'Todd you never asked me 
'Why I was chased the day we all met

All chewed roasted-pepperoni 
Front of a bonfire waves breaking near-by 

'For more than two years now
'Anytime I was at a computer at school

'I waited for a chance to create a listener

'I created code to work-with other nodes I set up
'Set to link together every morning from 1am-4am

'My first major hack was to get all synced
'To try and find a pattern to make sense of network traffick

'Had several functions of ingenuity to help crack it

anda hooted 

'pimped-out-bitches-like-hotcakes

A long banter flew up & over the audience
andy had tried hard to work on her timing

Ben took it back up

'Each node sent data back & forth in search of patterns
'Looking for the known protocol

'Simple mod over data-sets until data parasable 
'When a computation is parsable
'Each node will send to key to a printer I hid in a closet

'I jacked the printer from an insurance office
'They fked over our car insurance

anda shook her head at him disapproved

Ben defended

'My dad stole cash
'He was pissed I only took a printer

'Snuck it in with my winter-jacket
'Hide in the jacket-closet of Mrs. Stevens 

'Set it up in the janitors closet under the stairs
'Space unused and a nearby net-cable to splice

'I decided to hide at the end of the day
'Stayed in the room with a few bottles to pee-in & snacks

anda

! OMFG

Ben continued

'Spliced it into the network 
'Went back to sleep in the gym until PE woke me

'My dad flip-ta-bich-&-slappped-me-good 
'Turned out my plan to get away with it flopped miserably

'I got impatient & after a month I got desperate
'I waited till the Monitors 
'All returned after their trolls

'I was right in the middle of the hall
'When they left to go deal with Todd
'Mr. Dumbass walking around

'Instead they found me

Several cracks were made at Todd's expense

Ben drew them back

'My code should have cracked the key
'If its cracked it will be printed
'Just a grab-n-go

'I have the code written down
'I know there are no errors

Todd reacted

'You mean you have faith

Ben didn't take the bait

'Breaking into Uni
'Is most important

Jordan patted Jewels on the shoulder
All always rightly blamed her for their summons

'Maybe we sell ourselves too short
'Who else in the world
'Could crack that type of access 

'Get the data
'Plant an encrypted-bridge

'All seems prophecy to me

Insomnia the soil of Ben's childhood
Night the time Pops popped-caps

Ben always kept actively moving spots
Pops always managed to find him in time 
No matter how drunk 

Popped-a-skull worse the-longer-it-took
Decision to run crossed-a-line 
Trespass forgotten only after the haze-of-next-afternoon

All rant & abuse until then

~cost of new school shoes
~there kicked aside-disrespectfully

~coulda ate McDonalds 

~not the shit-which for lunch
~preparation cost
~the only two free-minutes of the gawddamnday

Ben avoided the clumsy-lunatic easily now
Clumsy-lunatic Pops favorite state-of-being

Once out of sight jump into a nook
He built lights in various places
Tool-set-flashlight in his pocket
Ben used the time to read

Hiding the only time to read
If Ben caught loungeing on couch 
Pops triggered like an explosion 

Once the wild reasoning

'If you didn't mark it
'There no point 
'Have'n to remember it
'Der dipshit

'If no point 
'Of have'n to remember it

'Then why the fuck 
'Would you read it boy

'We elect you
'Mayor Dipshit

Lecture under-pinned by pain
Pressure-points to be taught

'Yea you hate me 
'Well buddy
'All humans hate their daddo
'So fk it

'Lessons need to be learnt
'Dont mean you get em free

shin kick-sweep
locked-hold-grapple
wrist pressure-point

Acts that would be typical of an older brother
If they weren't always too-over-board

Abused by effect of drunk-tryhard-parenting
Ben had heard of worse reasons to be abused

Despite the weaknesses of his father
Ben looked-up to Pops 

Pops cracked to the core
Stuck as single-parent
Provide all in a hard world
_

Pops stole textbooks from the city library

Learnt Ben up on subtle-arts
Tricks too keen for school

Ben would wait in the car out front
Always on rainy days

Pop's favorite artic-military-coat

'Need a reason to stay hooded-up son 
'Two coats to steal-large
'Remember that one

Wisdom imparted in payment for guilt
Of what remained after hazey memories

Gleaming as a redeemed-man does
Passing down a lesson-for-the-ages
Endorphins-high rewarded by evolution

Returned with two large textbooks of random sort
Displayed like hunted-food for a starving-family

Dad always taking Ben as ingrate

'Listen shithead 
'When you get the balls that drop 
'And the skills like mine

'Only then do you deserve choice 
_

Pops a true muthrfkr 
Type to fk around casual 
Leave a virgin stuck with a babe for 2 years

Courageous enough to return to raise him single-handed when needed
A fact Ben used as pillar to keep the image of his father holy
Pops sober-intention understood now after months of contemplation
_

Ben eventually took up the tricks of his father
He accumulated a trove of out-of-date-unix-books 

~To lift up the shell
~To hear the C

Kerigan & Ritchie & Richard-Stevens 
Homogeneous kernel of unix networks
_

Pops once presented Ben a USB
As payment for listening a life-lesson-lecture

'Shit you never know
'When hell gets real

'Cops bust in

~oink ~oink

'They search evidence

'& Where is the USB
'Full of all the evidence?

'Out the puter
'Down your throat
'Before any seent you

Pops showed off the trick with a grin
Ben took it & proved the move

'All incriminating-evidence 
'In your shit at county

Dad down-to-earth genius which he wore too-proudly
_

Each year Pops needed less & less alcohol
To trigger into his habitual state

Reading a sensitive subject to trigger
Ben caught with a book in one of Pops moods

'Learnt is fine & well 

He slurred & slapped 


'But boy tell-you-me 
'no MAn a choose 

'bull-onie-bull-shit
'over real-life-skills

Kick Ben out of the room
Kick the book to the floor

'piss on books
'only fools follow

Laughing maniacally as if front audience
Ben with a mess cleant up quick-the-better

His personal library distorted piss-stained books
Highlights & notes distorted kept him re-writing & marking

//////////////////////////////////////////////
_

Pop phrases always popped back into Ben's mind
'----like fkn cop'
'----like your bitch ma'
'----like ....'
_

Six together around the large pit
Life taken in seriousness requires fast

Ben accidentally interrupting the silence
Then said fk-it-to-continue-rant

'lets see anyone else 

'takeover a whole region's traffic
'fknmuthrfkr

anda sighed out

'thank-god someone spoke

Jewels gave props

iss took the rebellion steamed

~Prepare

anda encouraged by Jewels burst into a rawl of her own laughter
ood evaporated without trace

'Oh right wit you gurl

'Just me 
'I prefer to 

~Prepare

'On a full stomach

Jordan honored

'fuck-tomorrow
'live for today
_

Food cooled to cold laid in front of bonfire
Each busy in a stationary-task

Hours of silence snowballed energies
Entangled to break an understanding

Stronger & stronger each passing second 
Entanglement-united in deep fight of will over all-else

Ben on a laptop
Jewels caligraphy, wiccan, potion 
Todd pen-set-out write down histories 
Jordan keep the fire & cook & knot

Hana made comments Jordan was the butler
Jordan replied she was promoted to his job

iss lectured

'Starvation-bonds reach to deep wells of power

'Exploited by the effect of pseudo-starvation

'Hunger in proximity to smells-of-food 
'Will quick-trigger a state of pseudo-starvation
'Any attempt used all power to adquire food

'Hunger empower of Passangers
'If they were wakened of state

'Starved host receptive
'Passanger acute awake-distinct
'More powerful if both starved

'Lessons from the best masters yourself

'Difficult to attribute work to yourself
'Mostly-likely-direct-product of a Passanger

All now ate the cold food in deep gratitude
Somberness an ashe coats pleasures of life

Todd since a child devoted himself to edification
editation, supplication & fasts 

Father broke a long-line of religious tradition
All family-notables lived in religious service

onks with well-written top
eticulously preserved father after son

Tales of the lives of his lineage inspired him

Grand-father had a dark-side around children
Line forever now tarnished by one individual

Father quit the ministry 
Swore off religion & burnt the bridge 

Lived as pleasant life working 4 10s at the refinery
_

Todd never been to church with family
Father never once talked about grandpa

Todd only ever migrated church to church
To find respectable individuals

Dark cults or enlightened-masses
Each obvious to the beholder
_

iss once drunk admited respect for Todd's intuition 
400 years put his example unparalleled

Pools of energy bloomed miracles in Todd's dream-state
He led hosts thru questions to fill holes of understanding
Tuned to the others frequency as bridge to pass messages 
_

Todd rants:

'I commit to morals
'Morals only modified 
'After any act itself
'To stand firm the main point

'Monuments of life 
'Done day-to-day

'New-doors opened-for-one 
'Opened to all-who-listen

'Each required to play part in fullest

'Jerk-off, play-tag, school
'All time sacrified
'For few life-long-ideals 

'Mathematical theory worked into notepads
'Pursuitant the reason why question asked

'Kung Fu kinetic logic infrastructure
'Stable actions as well-worn-responses

'Prayers allign mentalities
'Ease a sleepy-passanger into speak

'All morn kungfu wake me into algebraic-groups 

In stero-typical manner of all who do math
Ultimately to spend more time telling others of their hobby
_

Baby-blue-air lit to amber-orange
Deep summer day radiated heat

Full roar of ocean surrounded all

Waves full-bloom crashed
Four in the water

anda with Jordan behind instructing her


'sync your jumps
'or the waves will crash you against the baracles

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
\\\\\\ Manda ready to return home to face her family
\\\\\\ All in the ocean with Manda tied to shore with rope
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Ben had previously mentioned to Todd

'Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's complete collection
'Pops stole them all one by one over 10 years 

'I also have alot of mathbooks

'They are at a storage-container
'We could haul the lot with our bikes

Jordan jumped down still dripping from last dive
Legs tucked to his odd-shaped-belly
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Jordan dumped his belly-flop

! hella-doe-boys

Long echoe into a crash of water
He swam over to the others

Jordan presented a plan

'We drop Manda off

He spoke to Ben

'On the way head to that stash of books

'Go thru the books
'Book no-one wants 

'slang-dat-shit 
'fat-wads all-day

Ben countered

'Or mad points
'With the library 
_

Hurricane devestated this section of the bay
Homes long-since-abandoned in decay
Reminder to all short-memory-real-estate-buyers & forginers

Five in a pack at night on desolate streets
Neighborhood was dark & villianous 

Certain paths led them best ways

** ** ** (stop)
Jordan looked back

** ** ** (stop)
Jewels flashed lamp-code

Three trucks charged together down the coast below
Headlights thru streets in the fastest route to the group

Jordan hooted in a small call

'shit-gonna-git-real

Section of the city vacant
Decrepit residential neighborhoods soggy 

Jordan put them thru the nearest cut-thru
Three street-blocks crossed diagonal

Juked debris & leaped fences
Jewels tome-busted passages thru several dead-ends 

Back on their bikes 
Rednecks not to be out-witted 

Roar of truck lurched near

Immediately a black mass
Dove into view thru the backyard

Woosh-of-disaster

Truck bouncing on Supper-Dude-Springs
It crashed thru debris front the krew

Hood over the engine a heavily-fortified hull 

Truck drifted-a-j over wet-foliage
Overwhelming in the overgrown yard

!!! HONK 

!!! HONK 
!!! HONK 
!!! HONK 

Dirt & plants blasted over collapsed fence set between them
Till it rained down over the next building

! damn dem der it is

! DATS

! Billys Bike

!!! GIT EM

A hardy-bearded-oldman screeched in wolf-howl
Stumbling-out drunk or dazed-stoopid-from-the-crash

'My late-wife
'Gave thatta my grand-son 

! Billy

an stumbled out in a riot of cackles
In that empowered way to overcome sadness
Only theeth visble three brown teeth

! yall-gonna-paaaain

Speach allowed the krew time to pass out & thru

Two-other-trucks approached rapidly from other block
Enviornment grumbled in groans-of-the-rowdy-passage
_

Hauled-ass down perpendicular street

ovement as flock 
Jewels in the the lead 

They at times followed her to great pain
Unable to match Jewel's jukes failed into a painful tumble

They curved to circle into second-to-last-house 

Past the block only open grounds to leave them helpless against the stampeed

House, tho soggy, kept a sound-structure 
No-front-door allowed quick-entry

Swift headlights passed moments after

Todd whispered

! up-stairs

Trucks outside in mad charges as bulls
Nosed thru the neighborhoods lurching

Overestimating the stretch carried on
_

Trucks eventually pulled around to circle back

A voice shouted

'Billy keep dat outer-perimiter

'you understand dat sun

Old man illeterated

Ben took it running

'yeahit

Old man shouting to them

'We
'A gonna handle
'All this here

'That there bike
'Cost my dear wife some her life-savings

'& god-damned to yall
'If that helped her heark-attack

Old man called out into a hoot which curled to high pitches

! gaddamn-me
! for what we gonna do to yall

A hoarse, cracked teen voice yeller

'Run-em-down-dead
'As christ on the cross

Howls out windows 

! got my shotty
! pump-yer-ass-wit-salt

!!! ooooohhhhhwwwwwweeee 

!!! YIP

!!! saves-ya-to-feed-as-bacon-to-my-pigs

Five shadows moved as a group house to house
Pumped in riot & bashing deep-inspection 

Effort imperceptiple at such levels of intoxication
Not till umpteenth house the hunt became a labor
A hard & disgusting labor to search abadoned houses
Vomit-inducing sights met them unexpected

A fat man huffed to gather the squad

! you-wit-me
! bobby-go-wit-earl

' We got this house ere 

Hoots of compliance

!Chk er down
!chk ER down
!chk-er-down

oments later a crash & bash down stairs
A crash at the stairs followed by a curse

! fuckaroo

'damn-fuck-cock-bite-stair
'jimmny-crickets-whore-of-a-mother


! BOBBY 
! EARL

! pull-er-ass-here
! help-me

A voice went outside to call out
Bobby, Earl & the trucks

! dumbass-dipshit-hurt-himself

Four others helped carry
Wounded grey-beard to a truck

Bobby yelled from his truck

! HEY YOUS
! FUCK FUCKAROOS

! DIS HERE TRUCK
! CALL HER


!!! RUMBLE
!!! RUMBLE 
!!! RUMBLE

! DOOOMM
! HAMMMERRRR

Loud-screech lost itself in the maniacal throttle & Heavy Metal on 808s

Truck logo:

~Bobbys Best
~WRECK & CLEANUP

! ole-mother-fucker
! designed to clear this shit
! how-fucking-funny-is-that-boys

' done't earnt
' yerselves proooofesssionales

A shrill accusative yipped 

! THiEVry

Justified the truck took out the corners of the first house 
Down their side of the block

Two on each side of truck linked the chains to the pillars of each house

One worker shouted glove on the right hand
A fith-of-something-cheap in his left hand
Leather-utility-belt hung a laborer-hammer

! I-aINTA-WURKED-DiS-HaPPy-SINCE-VEGAS
_

Pace & efficiency alarmed the group

Jordan trapped in despair

~fuck-oh-fuck

'Gotta keep it real

Todd pointed thru lookout window

'They left the hurt guy in the smaller truck 

'Imma sneak up behind
'Take him down

Todd convinced them

'We only survive if we get a vechicle
'With bikes we lose

Jordan offered

'Take over the truck then reverse here
'We throw the bikes in the bed 

'Skurr-skurr for sure
'You got this Todd
'Ill back you up

Todd declined

'I move better alone
'Just be ready

Todd's tactic relied on surprise
Two meant double-chance to be noticed 

Failure sacrified Todd as distraction 
Chance for others to escape an otherwise sealed-fate

Hand-to-hand combat a dependable solution

Todd left out the kitchen window
To follow bushes along the front

Section after section Todd steathily-crept 
Snail-movements put him under rear-cab driver-window

A locked-driver-door meant his luck ended 
Tonight not their night to die

A solid thrust up the handle locked-halfway

A voice inside rose

'whadda

! whatdafuck 

Todd's heart dropped
Passanger prepared trick 

~Back Bed

Todd luckily placed in good position  to swing himeself onto the back bed

Truck lurched as Todd scrambled upright
Four wheel drive thru rumble of the front bushes

Todd on a bull-of-a-ride
Thrown hard here-&-there

Guy caught-up in manual-transmission with one unusable foot
Old man meant to get to the other truck 

Rednecks always have something in the bed able to break a window
Todd took hold of a metal-rod

Truck-bed jolted left in airborne jump
Truck crashed his shoulder into a tool box

Wheels purchased pavement again
Todd bleeding but no time to tend wounds

Todd immediately obliterated the back window 
Over-swung-rod continued to a red-line across the-head

! yyyyeaaaaoooohhhhhh

Driver experienced to safe-habits saved both their lives
Todd tossed inside among frantic inter-actions of transimission & gas

Todd mid-air hips planted drivers skull into the windshield

'ArGGRreh

Old-man grunted stoopidly
Vehicle stopped dead in a bush

Other truck busy gathering-the-men had caught themself in a mud-pit
Only knew how to rememdy the situation as a pack of trucks

Old-man keen on life
He opened the door & let himself roll safetly to grass

Todd took the truck hard twice

Old-man crackled in shock

! fucking-manual
! motherfucker
! gaddamngears

Todd threw his handsign
Right leg & hand moved independent

Truck lurched reverse & spun right towards his friends
Todd kept 1st gear till the house roaring in RPM

Truck of rednecks first tended to the old man 
Family first over vengance

Attempts to honk at Billy left unanswerd

Todd's body screamed in pain
He stopped outside the house

Flumbling out like-wise the oldman

Ben took the wheel 

Jewels & Jordan hauled Todd into the truck-bed

iss went work to patch up Todd & set back broken bones 

Jewels massaged Todd's wounds with a balm as he slept
Pepper-balm-sand-clay-scub 

Peppermint prepared leaves to layer afterwards 
All coated by root-oil to encase Todd in herbs
_

Todd patched up & able to rest in the cab of the truck
All grateful to be in-doors

Jordan spoke

'Manda we drop you off
'Can we leave Todd with you

anda kept unresponsive

Concoction blotted Todd unconciousness
Todd hauled thru Manda's window 
_

Jordan directed Ben

'Lets haul all the books now

Supermart closes in an hour

' Lets do a supply dash
' Unless yall too tired

Jewels

~ nah fk that
~ you dont wanna go
~ you sleep imma eat
_

Ben underestimated the quantity of books Pops stole
Jordan & Jewels left to filter all books into two piles
He first drove to the utility-shed to stash the food
_

Jordan stood outside the glassdoors of the Library

'aye

! tack 
! tack 
! tack

Reluctant guard eventually came to the door

!4am 

!outtahere
!libraryclosed

Same guard from the years back
He turned making his way back to his lounge

Jordan yelled back
! truck in parking-lot packed stolen-book

Guard ignored him too tired to care

An hour & the involvement of the other guard
Required to get the guard back up

'Dude
'Im fucking serious

Jordan assuring him as he opened the door

'hella-books in a truck

Guard unbought

'Yeah & Yeah fk-off dip-shit 
'library closed

Jordan caught back 

'You dont remember me? 

Gaurd now woken complete

'Oh yeah I remember you
'I remember you stole from me
'After I fed you

Guard about to snap

'dick with me today... 

Jordan speechless-from-sadness disarmed the guard
Guard subsided to follow Jordan into the lot

! fuck

A tarp bound the buldged mass of books
Several fell to the pavement as if leaking

Guard jaw-dropped

'Shit-load-of-books

Guard looked back in friendship reknewed
Redeemed from the sharp pains of betrayal

'You just got me promoted 
'Thanks Jordan

Jordan only able to nod & let the guard get busy
Reconciliation a comptemplation to keep him the next hours
Three packed the book & supplies thru the rabbit-path

Walking dark streets at a brisk
Something mechanical in his hands

After quick-glances all-directions at the corner 
He wrapped a bungee-cord around the post

echanical-device set on the cord to point towards the street
Lasers set the camera scan of the intersection for traffic

Passing cars triggered a recording-feed-alert via radio
Feed linked to a screen banded to his arm 

6 of them set up
2 minutes of estimated reaction to prepare
In that window of time he was sure of anything 

He crossed the street to verify the device
Arm-Band lit up with his potato-quality-image
_

Warehouse at the docks sat alone in the open expanse of the lot
Waves crashed at the corner of the open lot in heavy sprays

Network scans revealed this location as a common gateway
Weeks to prepare for this night
Coiled ropes & cords flopped outside of his pack

Street front the open-lot he paused to center-chi & handsign

'find the office
'find the gateway 
'hack the gateway

'Run this cable along the gate
'Set it up to the city-utility-connector

He turned & pointed to a green box at the end of the lot 

'New cable will upgrade the connection
'Which I will slightly tax

He went forward in a rush of energy

'Keep tabs on my wrist
'When it lights up be sure 
'Nothing is missed

~show-time-muthrfkrs
~keep-it-real

Late hour kept alerts down

an approached the fence

'Probed an oceanside-window last-week

'Security checks up a few times a night
'No system to the timing

Along the fence waited two-minutes with no feed

He only needed 20 seconds
Nike-Free soles molded to the fence
He jumped up & over in fluid-silence 

Fences his expertise
Preferred hurdle to set tween chasers 

ovements direct & pre-planned 
Base of the two-story office-building in quick cover

He looked up to the window probed last week
A loory alerted & passed 

Took off his pack & un-latched the rope
One-end clean-bowline achored to a thick-pipe 

Window-ledge hoisted jump to a solid throw
Rope now set for the ascension & rappel

Sensitive the man responded
'GriGri
'Dont know whatcha call it
'Every-possib has em
'Simple physics really

Opened the mechanism to demonstrate the core

'Main point is find it
'These will save your life

Hand ascension set quickly with carribeaners
He set the line with his weight to walk vertical

Quiet-movements swift in a flow
Done in Qui-Gong breathing-techniques

Feed-alert flushed him against the window

He worked open a rusty window with a thin steel piece
Remarkably similiar to Jordan's tho looked decades older

Slipped his body narrowly inside & shut window

'Only leave windows open if there is danger

usty-warehouse ordor with wiffs of fish-reek
Office-quarters sectioned into cubicles

'You expected fish-smell? 
~weird

Family-portraits & anti-stress-toys on desks

After quick inspection of the floor 
He tested the locked stairwell door

Network lines followed into a locked-closet
Whur of computers inside assured the location of the gateway-box

A pouch removed from off the pack
Only after clumsy effort the door opened

He used two extremely thin-yet-strong rods

Inside with laptop out & on
Ready for the mission

A bogus label on the laptop

-DNS SERVER-
-KEEP ON-

-network will not work if off- 

New cable to connect laptop between gateway-box & ISP box 
A new label placed on the company-gateway

-troubleshoot
-check DNS server on

Gateway-box had a sticker detailing the network of the Internet Serice Provider

Information directly configured into the laptop kernel
No need to get into the gateway-box

an-In-The-Middle attaches between two point & pretends to each end, itself, the other end 

ISP->MitM->gateway
gateway->MitM->ISP

After laptop rebooted with new configuration 

 ==================

Ben woke from dream & wrote it down 
A photo on a clerk's desk called out to him

Family around a sign on a sandy beach
~Pilgrims Pennesula
Icon of the characteristic-coastal-bay engraved

He recognized the part of the coast
_

Dunes spring time
Jordan out snorkling with Todd

Tide nice & calm 
Skaters waited their turn on the beach
andarins thrown around 

! kingpin

Skaters greeted Ben
Clay Dorsey Javi & Homer

Ben joined them & caught an fruit 
He waited for Jordan & Todd to return
_

Jordan replied to Ben

? Pilgrim's Pennensula

'Never heard of it

Ben drew the shape with his fingers upon wet sand 

'Shape of the engraving
'Put it just south of the Bluff
'Right there

Jordan smirked

'no-shit-murlocks
'Well thats the answer

'Not much of a vacation spot
'In this reality

'I been out there once

'Maps read it to be a NeverLand
'Miles from no where
'Fresh spring water

'I get there eventually 

He paused for their meal
_

Clay didn't know how to place Jordan
Jewels a bmx Legend
Ben the kingpin-hacker
Todd an odd-ball elitist

Jordan normal as any kid
Yet he always spoke to an understanding next-level-astounding

All been up since last night
Water gleamed off round shoulders

Last night they got to boasting
Pull-ups essential for upper-body-strength 

ade a competition out of it
Each to arrive at end & see where each strength settled

Jewels bored after thousands

Pull-ups best eased into over time
Stretch mandatory

Jewels instructed them

~  Grab arms-out-streched over-head
~  Lay-out abdomen 
~  Strech as bow

~  Hold elbows over-head 
~  Lean right & left
_

Pull-ups noticably power their bunny-hops

Leaping over a fence happens hourly at night

Feeder-by-turns
One would anchor his skateboard
Krew one-at-time run get up on the skateboard to be heaved in aided-launch

Up in the air to glide into a landing
Favoring the skateboard in first contact of the roll
Then helmet then pack

Each in turn first to fly
Lauched with skank-out-as-flag

Next up used skank to land & guide the rest
_ 

Jordan continued his story
Hardly a meal fruit-no-meat

~so-yeah
'About the Bluff

'I finally end up there

'hella-before-dusk

'Ready to bail back to the city 

'Found it a perfect place
'Set up camp & nighted deep into it

'Believe-me I could hardly sleep

'This place a Neverland
'Hours scheming new options 
'Infinte places to set-up camp

'Soon as sun went down
'Buzzes filled the air

'Swarm black against black night
'Worst night of life

'Kept all night gripping my bag shut
'Bugs collided into sack all night

Jordan made a tsssss at Ben

'If you go out there
'tssss

'You deserve what you get

Todd felt a draw towards it

'We go tonight

Jordan face-back-attitude 

'Da-fk
? Only to troll

Todd reassured him

'Full moon should keep bugs-down 

Jordan palm-face 
Ben took up the challenge 

'I bet 4 supply trips
'Place a landmark-tourist-attraction

Jordan took it

'Bay took almost a century to clear out
'Logically the Bluff an ideal first-landing

'But with all the hurricanes
'Any place would have cleared out long ago

Well assured any nights suffering 
Worth four free runs

Jordan least busy yet he treasured idleness

'Prob different in this existence

Clay broke in

'Dorsey you in

Dorsey declined

'Nah
'Chill at the beach
'Imma hit up Sabrina 

Clay settled it

? Out far
'You need bikes right
_

Back down to their core 5
Out to the highway 

Dismounted & walking with bikes for the feeder
Hitching a ride southside the oceanside-highway

Over-sized truck pulled over
Eager to make-use-truck-bed

Scratchs & dents 
arks of reputation in Texas

an at about 50 wearing a decade-old truckers-hat

'Yall take trip this late
'Not much to do out our way

Jordan replied

'There is a party 
'Southside at the Bluff
'Ben-here gots a date

Jordan nudged-openly at Ben

Call getting the old man's hoot

Travel-moochers must be good company
For-karmas-sake

Old man now jeered

'Throw yall bikes in da back
'Cab big enough
'yall come inside

'Pray someone gets laid tonight
'I aint got no possibility now
'Old-hag divorced me
'Took everything but this-here-truck
'Put this fine-lass in the PreNup

His meaty-hand slaped the dash hard proving-the-rig

Jordan always kept their packs in front when hitching
A good barrier & first-contact-pad if one had to jump-out

Old man cackled-loudly the entire time 

'Any particular place on the bluff?

Ben put in

'HEB 
'we need to get a few things

Oldman parked front-the-store

'Im just around the corner
'If I see yall again 
'I pick ya up

Jordan asked crawling down the truck 

'Can we get you a 6-pack

Oldman's eyes glinted
Hooting into the night

'Moonshine keeps my figure

He didn't get this old 
Letting youngers buy him alcohol
_

Fresh supplies always hard-got
Stores hevanly places of plenty

Jewels gave props to Jordan

~ ace-hitch

Jordan smiled back

'Yeah that geezer legit 

'We can scout a base
'Camp eazy-time-to-spare

'Test out our new mega-net
_

Cashier looked upset by their selection
Obnoxious-in-cost & too-much-to-carry

Bandages behind his ears hid-tattoos
Black long hair sleek hid-the-bandages


'Those bikes yours out front

Cashier jocked at their bags

Ben fished info out of the cashier 

'There is a party here tonight
'Pilgrims Pennesnula

Worker started-up 
Oily thin strands of hair stuck-to-his-startled-expression

He turned & looked side-to-side then to face them

'Kay first
'never mention Order matters here

'Kay idiots

He leant in closer all bro

'Tonight 

~at midnight yall
~is-gonna-be
~HELLA

Clerk sang into a low-whispered-dance

'Just keep on Jalisco
'Straight after the barrier
'Just wait your turn on the train

Deep-folds-of-skin on his neck leaked oily sweat

! it-gonna-be-tittys 

'So wassup girl 
'See-you-tonight

Worker appraised Jewels figure
uscular legs in stockings & shorts
_

'A-holy-fk-this-wind
Jordan grunted a ways down Jalisco

ain street of the town to terminate here
At a straight-shot back to town 

Ben shouted
Bags anchored in such wind

'Better-than-bugs

Jordan yelled

'Stash sup & bikes

'Find a bush
'Eyeshot to the barrier

He pointed at the road-blocked steel arm
Gate locked off vehicles to the area

Todd chirpped 

'I wonder 
'What possibilities would have been
'Without the hitch

'So many random-events
'Create such drastic trajectories

Jewels faced Todd 

~Or they 
~Drawn to us

Jewels now saw the truck
Roar past ever seen

vrooooom!

Call of a god of machinery
Paralyzed krew achored bracing

Near a fly-tumble shot out
Tumbled to land & stood before them

Clerk who put one on Jewels

'NAR

He now presented himself upright
Suspenders & no-shirt
Flip-flops work-safe no-slip

Righthand a personalized-bottle

'Yall got tit turnt yall

Last word an offer of the potent
Liqour-fumes off the uncorked bottle

Jordan near vomited
A reputed give-no-fks-stomach

Jewels gets up in it

Her thumbs up taken easily
Clerk had already had his

Gills greasily eased into a

'Dat my cuz dere
'Hope we not scare the misses

Clerk made a wink at Jeweles

Relaxed into krew as if he always there

Complete opposite to the gut-instincts

Jordan led the rebellion into a stand-still

Perfect-teacher to a school-of-fish

! zupp zupp

Hour after hour air smelt more like ocean
Jordan de-throned-king-of-directions

Humble-tranquility notable is such grand-figure-of-our-time
Jordan now had finally found a best-friend-master



_

Sting of sand brought packs-up to protect their faces
A mile & half past barrier end of the pavement

Puddled dirt path led forward 
Each turn more extreme

Tire treads scarred earth in deep imprint
ud pit after mud pit impossible to most vehicles

Jordan pointed to a hilltop
Lone it loomed over the bay

'Deer paths better
'Than this shit-cake-show

iss spoke out

'This part of the bay 
'Hit-gold round the 60s
'Karma swept it all away

Gray-clay clung each step 
Streaks smeared along calves

Sanded-wind no longer a blight to them
Wind blocked by the extreme up & downs of the passage

Jordan happy

'No bugs yet this path aint so bad
'Only got to carry a de-shitter-stick

Jordan gave an example
Scraped clay off his shoe in one movement of a stick

Jewels a nervous wreck to keep her Tome clean

Thickets dense yet always with animal-traffic
Trails connected into mazes of paths 

Hilltop visible most times

iss stopped them with a whistle

! whiirp 
! whiirp

Jewels set her pack down to kneel
She gathered a bush of dense aromatic-herb
Clippers & twine Jewels made four sachets

~rare
~good luck

All wore leather cords to drape sachets 
Flagged them amoung others as distinct

Bags of dried herbs & fortune charms

Todd regained strength

'This place aint so great 
'Even-without Jordans monster bugs

Toke & refreshments 
Then they mounted packs

Up a steep hillside
Thicket trunks as ladder to climb at-times
_

Hilltop suddenly broke-away to panorama

Dark shoreline illuminated under moon
Great waves of the ocean hurled into near-by-beachs
Outcrops of dark boulders in the distance

Jordan lamented & pointed 

'Buildings south-west 
'50 feet inland

'Off the barnacle outcropping

'You can see the straight shadows of the roofs

Ben without doubt only waiting eventuality 

'You should have known better to bet against me ole-boy
'How long you gonna survive
'If you bet against people like me

'Four runs full of computer equipment & the like

They set up camp in the sunset
Stitched-together mosquito-nets

Clouds now-only-parted after sunset
After return with the supply-bags

Jewels danced around serving herself Twinkis
~ feast all now
~ HEB way back

Jordan

'Even the hike not too difficult
'This may have been our most smooth adventure yet

Jewels smacked him back the head

Jordan recoiled sorrowful

'muthrfkr-I-cursed-dam-it

Open hilltop enshrouded by the thickets 
Summit a small barren area eye-shot to beach

Camp set secluded below the sand-worn-platau
Deer trails led only those who knew how to read deer-trails

They left camp to inspect the site

Jordan got them on a straight shot to the beach
Beach walk shoeless to the distant buildings

~Pilgrim Pene... 
A sign half-buried-by-an-accumulating dune to the side

Ben pulled it out

'Exact same logo

Jewels signed at Ben
~trippy

iss long-since asleep in her belly
Jewels woke her up with a burt

iss burrowed her way up
Got set up all right
Then rapt Jewels on the head

All buildings degraded from decades of age 
All heavily-boarded as to block all entrance

Ben gave-up 

'To get inside any of these required
'Half the building torn down

Trucks roared in the distance

Pack followed Ben's dream to the Bluff
Frontier of thickets & road-for-crawlers-only

Hilltop at the Bluff overlooking the beach
Once named Pilgrims Pennesula
Wiped from maps

Crawlers arrived loud & slow
Each trick-to-shit-truck hull connecter to the aft of the forward

Only pulled or one drug
Each to their slow crawl

Drivers comminicated to the whole via lights
Driver communicated to their front-back via radio

Each on swing in a tree top an over-looking hill

Jordan accused Miss

'Why didnt you tell us

iss look backed ignorant

Jordan called it bullshit

'That building-wood less than 
'the-fk-long-your-centuries

'I know you know I know
'So just so you know
'I know

iss fluttered her umbrella 

'Hey a bet is a bet
'If you would have backed out

'You would only have lost sooner

'I like to see these things 
'Played out naturally

Jordan unsatisfied but beaten

iss assured him

'You loser face is so cute Jordan

In turn passing binoculars

Rednecks in merriment of logistics

Barrel-man some type of mix between pagan-pope & local-drunk
seed-far-fallen from German ancestry

oonshine in an over-sized-wooden-barrel
Wood bound with steel with its steel pour-knob glinted

Calves of man thick as monster
Keg hauled on back or hug out-front

Jordan lost in amazemnt 
Himself couldn't manage those feats even without load

All had cerimonial gauntlet
Eager when their time came

~to be washed 

What looks like they called it from binoculars

Each once cup filled-to-brim 
Take it down all at once-handsigns

Barrel man a certain-type-of-mix
Between pagan-pope & local-drunk

! vroooooooom 
! vroooooooom 

Headlight beams upon low-clouds 

Firewood netted-down on truck-beds
As-if an entire forest to be sacrificed

Each helped haul the other 
A train-of-trucks connected by chains

Each pulled the other along in turn
To unlink at the beach
Dunes set up with a launch run
Sent sacrifices Dagon way

One charged fearless up the runaway and shot off the ramp
Rocks & sand sprayed as it landed then slid in a skilled-stop 

Jay-drifting bed-flap released nets archoring the firewood
Rocketing the loose-fire-wood into an accumulated mountain

Over 100 trucks arrived
Trucks all parked neatly single file

Light flickered in blazed of enormous bonfires
Buildings all operable in service

Booths of live animals
Fortune telling & street-magicians

erriment wasted on alcohol

One truck hauled a tethered cage
Truck after truck hauled a tethered cage on a rail
Truck jolt off a sacrificed animals into deep-sea

First anchored-chickens then pigs then sheep
Goats were the oddest-acting-creatures when flying
Each looked as if it excepted to one day fly
_

Robesman made rites aroudn the bonfire pillar
A great thin fog froze as monolithic-clouds

Each driver with gas in the gauntlet
Siphoned from their tanks
Tithes to fire-pit 

Party-a-coil around the fueled mountain 
Summons audible on winds

A dark object arose from the sea
Long form drew the LochNess dragon

Large fins stepped to the beach
It approached the erected wood

A flash of strike invisible to the hilltop
Lochness sniped half the body of a man
Which it flung up & crunched down 

In a great roar the dragon stood upon hind legs
Falling into a bellow & flame-lashing-as-whip
Aun hilltop shuddered as the creature landed

LochNess returned to the deep
Bonfire lit up in explosions that lauched several logs

Aquatic-beings arose from the deep 
Some took the wounded invitingly 

Dance drank & mate 
Intoxicated merriment

Dragon retreated into the horizon
LochNess head visible as distant sentinel

Tentacles foamed out at the shallows
Tentacles stretch miles from deep-abyss

Source megolithic past scape-of-view against ocean landscape
_

Auquatic Robesmen in odd-shapes joined those on the beach

Encircled the crowd from ruckous into silence to chants
Odd-aquatic-hums of deep-water

Line hand-bound uncoiled towards the deep
Towards the outcrop of barnacled boulders

en & Women & Fish-people in odd-orgy 
Foamy-tentacles the medium of sexuality

Tentacle-nipples sucked body in lustful-pleasures
A prescion to expound pleasures hundred-fold

Electric-plup-sacks-soft-yet-firm-jelly
Tingled refined-levels-of-inticement

Tentacles hairy of all types & color
Hair striked as whips to naked flesh

Distant human forms flung up upon cum
Caught and cleansed in waves by god-like-appendages

All unkoothe
_

Green glow lit the horizon
Believed to be illuminesent-algae 

In time it drifted distict & apart
A single small orb drew all in a light
Light more a fog than a billiance 

Impossible detail opened to Todd
Green glow pulsated hungrily

Emerald-green-orb folded into golden scales 
Set top a scepter in fine-ways of master-craftsman
A hermaphadite-god enlaid upon it as crest
_

onstrosity flailed in the high-winds hours
Tentacles fucked-all-one-to-another as puppets

an woman tentacle intertwined to monolitic movements
Rolls of flesh in vibrating unity

Foamy-scenes of garganteuam-enviornment
Sex-smell thick in the dense-foggy-air

Ride over all dismounted in a beach-ward swim 
Chain of victims linked by arm walked into water

Unlinked & snapped up by tentacles
Shriest & cries & terror drawn to an end of utter-need

Lust of the tentacles gripped each in deep care
Pulpus forms molding & humped aggressively 
Nipples now hard knobs

Foam spouted out of the orafices
Hotly layering the naked bodys

Great shocks of electricity sparked-arcs tentacle-to-tentacle
Air filled with wails of the deep pleasure of pain

Air now all hot in steam-of-it
Sauna of sexual particles

Orb out-shone full-moon in bright-green-glow 

Each person upon release locked in stasis of electricity
Blue light iluminated the frozen-forms

Each in turn awakened caught in full-bloom-of-lust

A freshness devoured tastily
outh crunched & smacked noiseily

5 Students in a library on the second floor
On a balcony overlooking the floor below

Government officals stood attent 
Children presented their impossible-discoveries 
Rings of power set in velvet boxes

Rings tracked-down against all odds
Items of legend to world-wide-press 

Attained by these children
Easily as if rings awaited them

Students honored & proud

Jordan's voice spoke inside

~aint-gonna-git-me-suckah

'muthrfkrs are ganking you

Kid took the hint whole-heartily
Immediately before the boxes collected

In feint manuverd by Jordan
He re-lifted the LOCHNAR ring
As he closed the box-lid

Green-orb reassured his palm with warmth

Officals promptly recited their routine-disclaimer

'You will have no more dealings with these matters
'Any attempt would mean the end of your family-line

'You service to this government will not be forgotten

ilitary Police saluted then escorted them out briskly

Cast-shattered-faces-of-friends

If not for quick thought himself like-wise
If not for the quick odd-thought & grab

Government all on the upper-floor
A swarm in relish of the spoils

Kid quick out at bottom level
But one of his mates quicker
He ran up

'Hey I saw you
'You didnt give yours

ate shoved the kid back towards the second-floor

'You will get all our families killed

Undaunted the kid pushed ahead 
Outmatched-mate yelling vengeful

! He took the LOCHNAR
! He took the LOCHNAR

Typically ignored by adults
Drowed in celebrations 

All who knew the call's significance
Too deep in the party to hear
-

LOCHNAR a trusted-friend after months
Kid out submersed in the streets

Rings of Power drifted as winds
Past thru owners as one grasps air

Kid recovered several of the rings

Red-gem called to him in drunken-state
Gem in possession of several thugs

Those thugs now circled the kid's krew
Krew small-looking but elite in strength

'Heard you been asking all around
'about ruby jewlery

Cocky kid provoked back
This would be stealing-from-children

? You got it

an flashed up into a rage at the bait
Courtyard exploded full of rumble of the rough & tumble

LOCHNAR in the end subdued the thugs

Ruby jewel jumped away under a night-stand
Kid knelt down to retrieve the ruby 

Out came a little spider

'oh sir oh sir
'we serve we serve
'to you to you
'sacrifice sacrifice

Gray of hairs in semblance of royal ancestry
ajestic mane a coat of many grays

'Eight Legs Eight Legs
'Many eyes Many eyes
'All yours All yours

Kid agreed compliance

Spiders after milenium in waiting to rebuild kingdom by the Ruby

00000000000000

Under hot-tarps mid-day till sleep available
Breakfast-dinner & de-camped over a light-fire 

No trace had been left of the night
Gulls cleaning up had an over-sized greatness

Jewels knew that one of the 100 had spotted our bikes
Yet Jordan proved true again 
Tho admittedly the bikes were out-in-the-open

! CAR

Texas flat-lands allowed plenty warning to a car approach at night
Past midnight but sweating in the humid night

Krew dove into a secluded-spot
Aided by the camo attached to their packs

Scotty tandem with his new gir Kitty

Scotty begged that Jewels get him the bike
Then all journey out to the Garden

Jewels figured Scotty easily owed the bike 

~Bye Bye
~Sweet American Pie

Hummed in the faith, tonight the two would lose-virginty
Garden a perfect place Scotty promised Kitty 

Kitty plump-perfect-breasts
Breasts hung heavily yet perky

All under load 

Jewels had the Tome & mixtures
Jordan hauled firewood on trailer
Ben had tarps & supplies,
Todd hauled-all-else using Jewel's trailer

Old one-pump-station marked the midway
Always visted on the trips to stock up

Krew full speed non-stop
Store longsince-shutdown

Familiar smell grumbled Jordan's stomach

Jordan heartless-filled Todds-trailer
Now all thankful for Jordan

Dark-clouds passed-brisk in bay-winds
Bright moon faded in eclispes of clouds 

Contrast empowered Jewels to embue powerful spirits
Hillside her tools laid out on the grass on a work-blanket

Soctty had all in a stir with his sweaty work
Tho impossibly larger above
Hill in such times too small

oon high when Scotty & Kitty returned
Aura bloomed into the maturity of satisfaction
Ultimate satisfaction of naught-else-higher

Scotty iceberged the titanic-of-awkward
Explained holding Kitty bashfully

'Kitty these are their states 

Scotty counted them down for her

'Brew state gave powerful dreams
'Smoke state to inspire them before journeys
'Balms to calm imflamations of deep meditations
'Edible state purged them before fast

Jordan ventured freely

'Due to the feminine-lure of drugs
'We five are often blitzed in those states

'In fact Todd calls it meditation

Jordan shot at Scotty

'Remember the waffle-maker

Scotty jumped on Jordan to silence him
Now the frozen hillside erupted in shatters

Jewels imediately filled the vacancy next to Kitty

~ Miss go to sleep

iss startled

'Well now 
'hear me
'...before 
'you give me a bed tiMe...

Jewels stuffed Miss down & into stomach

Awestruck by it Kitty looked-back-up to Jewels
Eyes big of questions & girl-talk

~ tell me
_

Night wore on

Jewels prepared a faggot with Kitty
Embued by the energies of sexuality
	weed, flowers, dried herbs
	weed, driftwood, dried-sea-plant
	honey, leaf, 
All wrapped in a leather-tabacco-cord

Jordan's bonfire which once raged
Now it only a deep-slumber-red-coals

Tea while inhaling faggot
Wind directed their puff-puff

Ben's tarp formed a Tea-Pee
Around the encircled-fire

Hot-box-tee-pee

Vibes resonated the vibrance of spring-night

Kitty blushed to cherry awe 
Enamor Jewels first ever-understanding of the beauty of blood

Kitty in a state-of-being
So long imagined now lived

She took Scotty across the lake again

Cat unabashed to follow & creep from the bushs

All sexuality perked 
Kitty fk-else-fks-loud

Fingers into the balm Jewels snuck her
Spread over her nipples & then her clit

~oh the good ole 
in-out in-out

She sang in a pleasure of pain

Jewels been awaiting it
Burst into a seizsure of laughter

Yet nothing could tarnish a scene of Kitty lustful
_

Jewels out among the plants

Todd chewed a cluster of mint & cane cross-legged 
A comfortable desk kept here to write atop 
Start of the session of night-prayers
First above-all-else give-thanks

Ben over laptop powered 
He mostly first read logs

~logs are the flow of code
~understand the code by observing the flow

'Events of a system
'A cloud where one area affects rest

Pondering ambient ideas from logs

ountain-top in snow-caped Asia
Teen on a trail-run up the ridge

Path of it only difficult & narrow
Death only consequence of mis-composure

Night put this path impassable
Aun no place to sit

Slopes all drastic & divergent
Smoothe to prevent retrace on this maze

Ancestors kept this vale sacred
Journey for the boldest-of-heart

ission to fill two buckets
All the weeks sacred supply
To present to goverment goons

Their villiage enslaved

Teen answered the sentiment

'In this reality 
'Everyone is a slave

'A lone mountain spring
'Drip by drip by drip 
'Once a week spring fills a small pool
'Large enough for these two buckets

Steel rungs on each end of the staff hooked the buckets
Sturdy iron-wood-staff laid in steel & gold

This sacred relic allowed to be non-stripped

'Precious symbol of subjection & servitude
'Aun our mountain god

'But they are fools who know little of us
'Scrolls fortell a hero born from these slopes
'One prophisized to free the people

'He would never fall to the pits of the spring

'I have yet to fall in the pits all these years

Year after years on trails to train him
Paid too good to stop
No other bold enough
Every runner has died without exception

Passage across an art
Technical expertise in a finesse only permited-way

Necessary-outlet out of opressed-existence
Allowed to roam here free

Out here naught could lord him
Out here he king of the world

World as far as eye could see
'As long as you don't look over that slop

Trail ended before breaching ridge
Ridge of dark peaks like great spires

Runner could only stay in this desolate place as King
Until a meal came to mind

If another meal wanted
Necessary to return before night-fall

Todd amazed by the mastery of complex movements

Hip warm-ups the vital key

Low to the ground 
Buckets anchor points

ovements of a kung-fu master
Todd learnt deep paths 

Animal forms applicable to the present obstacle
Camel Mantis Crane Monkey Russian Bear Turtle Mouse Drunk 

Staff balanced on his neck he clasped his palms

Handsigns swiftly-executed 
Dab of precious olive-oil 

'Slavery will not break me
'Here subjucated as all are

'Tho slave 
'I am your master

'Proported powerful-being

'Here with nothing-to-my-own
'Built a marvel to all eyes

'Life in pursuit
'Of this simple mastery

'Tai Chi Qi Gong
'Breathe in
'Keep your center
'Breathe out & move

'Extend or contract
'Breathe in & keep your center

'Staff a double-polar-end 
'Stable four vector anchor

He tightened one hand & pulled with the other
With a whip of the back, the steel ignited against a rock

Once proud boulder chipped-off a good chunk

Todd able to speak

'I am of a tribe of Corpus
'Five of us live as nomads

'A comsic deity known as Dagon
'Will consume all possibility connected

Todd felt the lump down his throat

'We are fated to lose

'We are to learn how to kill his-image 
'Then we have to kill him 

Slave responded

'Always in dealings with fate
'Correct answer always to fight fate

'LOCHNAR has chosen you

'A power which when recieved empower all connected

'Act the night of moons-green-glow
'Fortune to use-opportunity

Todd caught a tight terror
He said nothing of LOCHNAR

Slave continued to fill his buckets

'Time to end the summons
'I never summon & trek

Todd braved out

'I can get you over the ridge

Slave cocked back

'That idea means succed or die all-in-from-the-start
'Passangers always act too rashly

Todd promised

'There is always a trail
'One to the top of the ledge
'Climb 20 meters up the other side
'To apex of the gorge
'You will find a deer trail
'I will lead you there myself
'Next lunar rotation be here
'Do not bring supplies or any unusual

Slave shot back

'There are never deer in this valley

Todd put it simply

'Then up there is your proof
'There a way out of the valley

Late spring-night on school-grounds

Groupings of tables by ledges 
Scene lit by yellow circles of outside-lights

Rear the school at the lunch-yard
Out-of-sight of any police passing
Too large a pack to heed security-guards
Security-guards rather-not call the police

Three packs joined up at this spot
A rollerblade crew invited by Scotty

Jewels stunted large

Ben of the undernet

Short-board-kid laid out a yarn in admiration

~hella-yea-boi

'Even soldt KEY$
'To three! teachs at school

$KEY pronounced ski

Short-board-kid counts off

'dealers second-handers hobos 
'taco-stand ...

Short-board-kid called out 

'Troy

Troy ethralled by the spell of watching Jewels stunt around
Dragged from the show

! Jewels
`Yo that inhuman
! We cant compete 

Jewels kicked up into flip
Shrugging-shoulders

~ so 

Troy blushed in appreciation
Needed a moment to calm down

Kid repeated again

'whats your weridest $KEY sell

Troy twirled his long-board 
Hopped on it in nose dive

'your mom is one

Dropped a 5-stair & rolled back
Troy backed the short-board-kid off 

'No joke I was at HEB

'Your mom talked to some other lady
'Recognized me & ran over

SBK got all up on him
But he didnt let up

'Please do you have a KEY dollar-sign

'Im all like uh... ski

'ohhh then she started to beg
'like a dog in front of bacon
'all drooly n wanting the meat

There was a less-than-friendly rumble
The most notable hurtful being the grunt

'Couldnt say no to a 
'your-mommy-sloppy
_

Just-learned-ollie-skater quick-shot Ben for points
Ben took up the offer to challange

The trial elongated as was the Bluff
Here without gray-clay
Appreciation bounced him since

Ben using Tome as a ramp
Rocketed on the table

bunny-hop-table-to-table 

Each table in line hit 
360 to land

A flash-of-ginger took him immediately
Full-body into a dense bush

Jewels taught Ben using her Tome was not okay
Ben angry-as-hell

'Hey I tested it out
'Did you a favor

'If it can hold me
'It may hold your cave-man-ass

Too-family in a friends-situation
Jewels burned of the energy of the insult 

All enjoyed the scene as proud-witness
Ben squeeled over & over like a pig

Ben's embarassmant eased eazy after
Night unmarred all kept to good moods

Rollerbladers yell all-sniff-up

! now lets tag-tonight
~ school forever marked in memory of tonight

Punks now demolished & tagged automatic-in-response
Freshman-blader a veteran prepared with an assortment of cans
_

~ BEWARE of the Esoteric Order
A colletive work 
Fenced off preserved as art as if comissioned 
Festive in the spirit of Dagon

'fk-da-police
'jen-ben-dun
(skyline of Titty-top-you-less)
(anarchy sign)

With the plenty others, washed well off after a year of service
Rollerbladers caught later & injustly linked-to-all 
_

Deep-night split-up & regrouped at an abandoned lot
Rollerbladers promised dirt hills for the bikes

Calm pure-humidity of early-morn
World slowly warmed to activity in the start of a new day

Troy lit up a Black & Mild
Tabacco cigar wrapped over a wood filter

Rollerblader fronted

'We do this all the time
'Tonight was best of all

? Yall nights all like this

Jewels stood up passing the blunt

~study worse over school

Long-night of renegade-fuckery
Body battle-worn from jukes & tricks

All weary for sleep went own ways
Cops be on look-out the next days
_

id-day weekends before summer
Packs out still-energized of reserves from long-winter-months

An old bank
A neighborhood spot

It didn't offer any advantage exceptional
Cept for a long-mostly-smooth-lane

Kids here got rocket-ollies well-worked

Jewels caught breath
All else in hopes to talk to her

A crowd teleported to her after the trick 
ostly kids who only hyped due to hype of other kids

Scotty & dealers under a tree in pow-wow
He hustled edibles-Jewels-made at a high price

Turnt on pull yet confident enough to transact
Dealers sagging Jinco jeans eyes-low-chill

'Dense bro
'Sure man we 

OG coughed out the Black & Mild 

~cough-oh-geezzz-too-high

'Yo Erick get the wad

He turned back to them

'Yea we will get the lot

OG approved openly to the scene

'Scotty is cool

All quickly resumed as if uninterrupted
Dealer motioning to break-out-here

Grinder-skaters set a pipe between trucks on a skateboard
Erik unscrewed pipe & popped out wads

'We hot
'so yall know

Dealer fished out a free nick sack & flung it at Ben

'Our product legit Jamaican 
~fresh-bomb-out-thick

Scotty shot back
'It got a name

Dealer smiled pleasantly
'There was a reason I didnt mention it
'But here it goes

'syrupy-as-SOUR-Gushers-stuffed-in-bag-hot-day
_

Posers & wanna-bes left-with-birds at sunset
Skate-pack stayed to get real-work-done

Tricks-stunt-extreme sure no noob to-crash-into-you-from-nowhere

Jewels busy at the run-way back-n-forth
Zealous as an itch long-needed-scratch

Grinders chip-to-shit fine-ledges of stone workmanship
-life-errodes
Long-since weathered grafiti to explain to bank execs

South Side rich kids rolled in with a over-sized-Texas-truck 
They had recognized Jewels & swung around to park

Rollerbladers lept from the bed
Each hauling a rail over their shoulders

Each-in-turn busted on the rail 
krew-vs-krew tournament with the trophy respect 

Clay skin-glinted-in-sweat skated up to his crew not-in-line 
The best at Miller & the best on this scene as Jewels didn't count


'aww shit man you see what I busted-out 
'540 chuck-norris to 180

'AND I got that photo-pose

Clay shouted back to the crowd around the rail

'We be bust'n on that rail like Bukake 

Clay turned back to lean in close to Jewels

'Jewels tell me you seent it

Jewels nodded leant on her bike
Rollerblader offered her the swig of vodka-Mtn-Dew

He stopped her

'Waterfall-only-the-rule 

The others around had each perched to get next sip
Gave the rollerblader his just dues

Clay called ou

!Abe 

'Get a rotation yo

Abe hooted agreeably trying to impress the dealers & the scene phat with rich-kids
He pulled sag-up & flipped sack out folded in the sagged-Jinco-jeans

! bout-time
! imma-learn-yall-up-son

'This is how Miller rolls dat 
'Cherry Blunt

Clay spoke up

'You still got grape

Abe made a bounce at it

'If there are two in a pack
'& We just smoked one

'hmmm Clay 
'you need math

Abe chuckled foretelling his future

'Koreans gonna rob you at the cornerstone

Clay unimpressed

'Hey Abe

~ Yeah

Clay blew-him-a-burd

'Watch this kid 
'Imma trick this shit

'awwwww yeaaah

Jewels shot back a tip-of the head
Standing aside her bike

Her smile a big-flash-of-white

Clay distracted crashed & flipped ass-over-rail
_

Dealer in circle ready in turn for the puff-puff-pass

'We all go to Carol
'Gonna hit a few spots after this one

'No rent-a-cops

Truck large enough to pack three krew
Up-n-over Harbor Bridge to the North Beach Acquarium

Lexignton & abandonded attractions 
_

6am dropped off back at Staples street

Abe passed Jewels the wood-tip-cigar
Smoke let out in a thick cloud all around on curb under tree

All reeked pleasantly in mellow-tabbaco-stench

Early-morn & hungry no lunch
Clay called out more-wishful-than-hopeful 

! A Run-Run 

Attempting to inspire a grab & dash
At a elderly corner-store open down Staples 

All pretended to buy into the plan until the arrived at street-nexus 
Their real intention revealed split ways home

Clay disappointed but expecting the reaction

'Ahhh I see how it is

'Yall aint so hard man
'Yall go home to a fridge 

~ but man
'I got to crash at Dorsey

'His place broke-as-fuck
'We gonna eat bread again

Dorsey shook the patch of locks back & forth

'nah nah man 
'I aint going there

oms new boyfriend a muthrfkr
Dorsey leant on Jordan

'shit Jordan hook us up with a crash
'we got no where to go near here

Jordan always the gatekeeper for their krew-spots

'Come on Jordan you know us man

Jordan knew this day would come
The day others would need to come to the Dunes

For this purpose Jordan had built a big-ass-obstruction
Conglomeration of rusted-car-tires-sand-sack-logs

Place looks like it been there decade
That the point of the turn-off-marker 

He moved the marker every couple months to throw off the trail
.
.
.
Summer breezes of salty air 

Sweat drained-un-ending off forehead & back
Out each day harder-than-before on stunt at hand

rail drop gap stair ledge slope
Farvorable lanes to secluded places like cemeteries

Different day conjoined to different krew
Corpus large but local-skaters kept certain spots 
_

Krew from Ray had two legit-kids 
Home-practice 1337 to bust-out-public

Novel technique unlocked at an early age got Jewels jealous

Flip'n their boards like coins
Yet each time 100% right
Total dominance of the 50% random-factor

Jewels day-long in ginger-sparky-red-flame
She her fails as great of her triumphs

Youngsters fueled in the cockiness of imporessing a Legend
ission to bump off the legacy of older-generation 

new-kids-on-block
_

iss always patched her together
iss usually drunk wine in nest

Helps deal with the turmoil of bmx-legend
iss all slurs & rants in unexpected-surgery
_

Last spot stuck far to east-side 
Trajectory askew by the sun & drugs 

Jewels rolled her iconic fat-cuban-roll
Blunt enfused to get them back-at-it

Potion unexpectedly reversed
Dumped them there square dead

Friend-of-guy came thru for solid
3am no-where-to-go-for-miles

Friend-of-guy wtf called outside well-past-midnight
Took-moment to dawn on him this mob now his problem

13 Bodies piled into a room, living-room, & garage
Dead-tired & able to pass out on anything

orn a swift-sweep by a triggered-step-dad 
Jordan trolled on his way out to help add fuel

Tired-each parted to re-sleep else-where

Lazy Sunday dragged into afternoon-ride
Crash-out & woke up well-after-necessary

Core-krew out long-hitch with just-met-company
Offer to join on-the-whim presented & krew accepted offer

Out towards East Texas wood-land hills
Famous river too-far for their home-town 

Ride would continue North towards Oklahoma
But they assured a ride back to Corpus

Jordan confirmed the way back much easier
Griends paid a tube & a bus upriver

Todd spoke up to the clerk
iss had whislpered to him from under shoulder-patch

'How much
'To be dropped off at the furthest?

Ben commented
'Dont be rude

Clerk broke-in only happy to settle the matter with good-vibes

'Its the same price
'We only drive full-runs

Todd in executive decision decided

'Be careful 
'High waters been known to white-water

Clerk looked at them serious

'Be careful high waters
'Here been known to white-water

'Yall git scared
'Just ride it out
'Camp o'r nite

Clerk looked up at Jewels assured

'By morn heavy rain-water set back slow
_

Robbins-family parted as quickly as had been met

Jordan parted thankful

'Thanks we wont forget this trip
'Only caz of yall
_

Dropped off alone out there hours 
Only a enraged river front

Driver made them promise to camp till morn
Todd did very sincerely

Jordan started to lash his pack to a tube
As soon as vehicle-left

'fk-dat-yo
'live for experience

No had reason to object
Each had two tubes, Jewels four

Tome had a reversible set-up
Food packed aside Tome as the safest location

Sun strong on them sweating
Jordan noised them all into assemple

! CARRRUMMMPPHHH

'Each has an extra tube 
'Guard each pack as if it own

'Shout out
'Person behind alerter
'Responsible for alerters pack-tube

'Todd agreed to roll 2 packs
'So he will be last

'Tubes will be tied in a long raft
'Each rides along a side

They entered the water in a run
First Jewels & Todd 
Then the raft, Jordan, Ben

At first the conglomeration of tubes difficult
Then after that first rough pach of river all calmed

Todd inturrupted the peaceful break in sudden yells

'Around the turn
'Just us get thru this gorge

'Around the turn
'Just us get thru this gorge

Todd completely correct
iracle forgotten so long of a turn

First-time experiences pale against dire-fright of next-hours
Severe-situations caused severe-fights which caused severe-situations
A vicious cycle

Ben broke his waterfall with boulder against his lower-back
Because the momentum was mostly forward serious damage avoided

Down river miles thru woods & ravines
All tumbled with them down-river

Animals would not approach the banks
Needful but patient they awaited a calm time

River finally pleasant & mellow
Each bleeding & exhausted from long-fright

Jewels had flipped-her-bit on Miss

Todd spoke for Jewels loud enough for Miss to get the message

! YOU ARE SMOKING CRACK IN  MY BODY 
! YOU-CRINKLY-WRINKLY-BITCH

This fight in middle of Jordans frantic orders to untie the tubes
Conglomeration of tubes a deadly-dumbassarie
_

Jordan pointed-out the approaching nightfall
Entirely relaxed leant against tube chewed cheese

'Go where we want all day

'Just set up camp
'At any these 
'beautiful bays at hand

'They got god-damn-sand

'oh-shit-Jewels
'!look

Across an ebb nested by dense-thicket

Nightshade-of-The-Witch dipped just above water-level
Jewels in a shudder of emotions unable to describe

Jewels drew out her dagger
Razor-sharp in respect of the plants & cat-skin she worked with day-to-day

She chose a bud from the bad & sliced
Set the bud in her preserving-sand

Jewels after time was known disappeared
Else-thought she been gathering longer
Expected it on how happy she was

TOME left there aside as she followed on a path
Thru the woods late at night without-word

Jordan flipped-a-bit 
A fit only learnt by Ben's example

! pack-this-shit-up

! RRRRAAAAAARRRRR

Jordan roared out to the world

'I will blaze my trail tracking her

'Ben double-check Todd's work

Todd gifted-him-the-burd
_

Breakdown & repack took the last of day-light

Ben excused by Jordan now flipped-his-own-bit
Expected she sure as shit be back by the time we are done

Cursing now that past hours time
Which was admittedly better after 
Hours of the the monotonoous call 

A shout full-volume

'i-see-the-fucking-moon-favor
'we-go-far-one

! she-leaves-us-behind
'she gives 0 shit

If Jewels returned she would immediately follow Jordan's signature blaze
Yet they fed off the crumbles which Jordan had to inspect much to find

Jordan by full-moon tracked the traces of her movement
Ben & Todd eager to learn from a master

ud of puddles the best signs
Of what had passed near its region

Jewels Dr. Martin bootstompers hard in passage

Beavers damned springs & creeks which fed to the river
Lily bloomed bogs kept all muddy  to Jordan's favor

All huddled over one
Jewels-foot-print clear as day

'bitch is near 

Work a great trial to push him past his limits
Power of her gait crafty in elusive ways

Everyone exhausted

Ben threatened a promise he knew he could never keep
Todd exerted a monumental victory in the feat to keep-silence

They had two choices when they packed
Bring all but the tubes & ropes or set up camp

Todd had them haul the load 
Himself borne down by the TOME

Todd climbed up to the second-layer of a tree

'Just over the next knoll an opening

Jordan jumped at it
Confirmed by the collision with Jewels tread

Open grounds restful, compared to the pain of bushwacking
Each lifted of spirits knowing this the last of the thickets

A small valley brought a lone knoll into view opposite end
Boys bushwacked-thru expecting to confront Jewels at any moment

Wiccan conjury became apparent
With each passing doll or carved-symbol each forgave Jewels a bit more

Evidences of decades of lonliness wore all the decades since 
Grayness of age overgrown by the dense-green-fugus-of-life

Satchets attached to trunks of trees
Idols & tokens to ward off unwelcomes

A great totem pole confronted valley passage
eticulously carved yet warped by time

At ease now 
Thicket behind them the last

Todd remembered from time with Jewels

'To lose sanity
'Only wanting home

'Basically thats what this does

A dark-garganteun-cloud cut all moon's light
True they all were insane already & Dunes remembrant

Spooked pack with Jordan led
Feel of his soles led the way

Todd thoughful left
Ben agressive right

Alleyup Jewels
also-known-as
icheal Fly'n Jordan

They could all travel 
Aided likewise to bushwack
Aun empty of the superhuman power of Jewels

Now here a place
So long hard fought-faith

Testified front blissful

Overgrown by decades
Up pathed knoll 

Breach summit at turn of climb

Caught there several seconds
Able with the skin to feel
Tho blind summit


Cloud finally past
Thicket broke as if by magic & slight hump of slope
Panorama of peaceful mellow meadows of flowery greenary

Jewels deep in meditation
Front the doors
Tired just-got-there

~oh fk my friends
~fk i hate when they do that

~oh shit Miss
~what do I do

Purposefully loud & long cries
Drown out any response by Miss

She also sees this pleasant sight
Her troubles all vanquished 
Only the echoes of those few moment's infinity

Boys on the other hand
Drew up quite a stir

She had to train the pack again
Build a better bond

bruised-boys-learnt-lesson
_


Poisonous thickets & large-maned-spiders guarded over gateless hinges

Wild cats
First one then slowly others

/// over harem inside a small cave
/// Groves of marijuana & catnip

Jewels in an open meadow
Standing there with Miss

Front a great-hut of a mother-witch
mother-witch being grand-master

Cat & Coon kittens together playful
oon-lit door-less open gateway

Omen welcomed the new-comers

Great well of water out front

Blue-gray stone all overgrown
Dark-greens moss & light-green vines 

Couple of kicks of Jewels
Threw back the world-off-course

Front-thick oak-door stubbonly flew across room
Fireplace pick scattered thrown across floor
Stone-exploded yet door held entact
_

Jordan quickly enamored with him self
Bugged Jewels in to the con of making all an shroom-elixir

Jewels needing to get busy con them into drinking it
Goys easily affected on shrooms would be out of her way

arshmello & neon kelidoscopes thru a lost land
Transported by a unicorn guide

Jewels put her heart into it
_

Trippy-now in discovery

Smell of aromatic herbs proved beauty of the witch

Robe thin around waist & busty above
Had a master-craft towards beauty

Oak-chests after centuries dry & preserved
Jars of what happens after centuries sealed

By some magic printinely preserved

A snake of great lengths uncoiled from center of firepit

Jewels broomed the snake out to the meadow

Snake took to its tail
Stopped first get a long gaze of Jewels

Crows cawed & flocks arrived
Fire ablaze & boys over-worked in spring-cleaning

Far-past-too-high-too-realize-they-cleaning

Door a sturdy work-bench for Jewels 
Her strength crafted her a sturdy to the core work-bench

Tome-spread-eagle
Packed-of-new-entries

bowls jars kettles papers books clohes 
seeds bound-letters preserved-herbs

Fish-bone long no.7 out & cleaned
Ink rubbed into service

Learnt of her old master
Now presence of a different master

Keh Kay Gen Kai
Conjoined of two 

Witches each drastically-different
Yet common themes apparent

Hut preserved mostly-only the better for the wear
Work the sweep of what accumulates after decades

Gigantic cauldron over kitchen hearth glimmered-clean
Black Obsidian shined sleek

Gunk nothing against the buff of vigorous Jewels

squirels bats birds mice cats
All stole glances thru windows

ice aun rode the felines
Yet cats regarded greater than mice

A fox cawed out fondly at front the door
Jordan rewarded it onf of his a dried-fish

Fox took the tip & skat off

Great-beam of moon bore down
Bright light kept all up

Jewels a slave-master always ordered chaos of trips-into-a-chore

~monotony helps the high
~mindless generate generic power
~used explicitly for a techique
_

grand-old-pecan to the left cottage overtook 3/4 of the bedroom
Braches of nuts inside the house in an organic fuse

Rear-double-doors suited to barrow out the ashes
Incineration a pleasant purge into dust

A great mound of ashe accumulated by next noon day 
Jewels had the boys mud-paste-ashe hours later next drink

An island-table boulder lay flat & stable
olded by unknown means to have several drawers

Jordan cleared out a rotted-cupbord
He pulled a rusted pot & triggered a trap

Trap turnt past-worn-boredom into panic
Arrows flung & whipped-roots-lashed 

All poisonous 

essage carved over the slab that released the weapons 

~FEAR WITCH
~AS SNAKE
~AFTER DEATH

Poisonous after all these decades
inor-severe wounds to all

Jordan pissed his pants
Tho blood made it hard to tell

Jewels just shrugged off the pulls 

~ no panic
~ all good

Jewels in lust as if this a long-waited-test
At her table 
Prepare ointment via herbs & flowers outside counteract the poison


Jordan asked confused

'da-fk wit her

Then the burn became audible out his mouth

! IIITTT BBBBUUUURRRRNNNNSSSSS

editation into nothing whilst Jewels concoct anti-dote

~ every witch grave
~ other witch treasure

Anti-dote instant relief
Pain & suffer turnt to relief

Ease as celluar massage
Purge cellers to better forms

Enlightenment lost-at-stiches
But regained quickly after patches 
_

Week went by comfortably

Jordan installed thorn-thicketeries
A blend he was able to morph in his odd al-chemic-wayz

After two summers own bushcraft naught penetrate barrier
Key out-tunnel down the 20-ft wide-well led out bypasse thorn-barrier

Journey much faster than the threat to retreat and manage position
Impossibly barred by a thorn-thickets too-green-to-burn
_

Field bloomed Kung-Fu energies in Todd to energize chi-root
Lessons of the soil & rock & root 

Three times a day

Jewels always the master of all
Boys needed to best her at one

Ben near insane & entirely difficult to deal with
His brain flips-a-bit when his last-battery-power-zeroes 

Jewels enthusiastic outmatched Ben's fits
Ben learnt to master himself in the corner sober
_

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Jordan dream not Todd
% Jordan learns boy is Yang Jwing-Ming
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
All bound after hasheesh & chants to sleep
Jewels astro-quantum-calendar proved true

Todd awake atop asian mountains 

Fingertips glistened late-sun-beams
Oil just dipped after facial dabs

'you are powerful

Voice of the boy unabashed admiration

'all of you god-like

Jordan took charge

'Jord here supz

He pointed along the sharp ridgeline

'most of deez moutain-sides 
'hella-flat

The boy interupted

'Yes that is what bars a ridgeline pass

Jordan audibly annoyed
For so guilty he was at interupts himself

'shhh
'shhhhhh

Jordan poked his hot iron

'listen

Let the acidic sink in

'k so 

'most of deez moutain-sides 
'hella-flat

'fk-assumptions
'what that means is this

'Wind would carry the smell of this pool of water
'Tho little it has large surface area

Boy admired
Jordan cocked out

'The smell would drive all deer from 
'The entire range over time
'As I am told its always full year-round
'That type of exposure would 

'hella-guarntee a path

Jordan confidently let in a silence
He let know was a sign of their need 
Upon his treasured counsel

He walked the boy along the small surface area of the cliff-ledge

! bAH

Jordan vomited out the spot pointed-finger

'there right here

Across the cliff was a narrow ledge too far possible jump

'all ridge-length trails
'would be opened to that nexus above that top cliff

'You summit that
'You can free your people

Jordan proved the green-gray-brown colors of hooves 
Scratch as a rebound bounce to make the distance 

'entry animals would jump down
'but not to land only re-bound to the next point

'which is there
'to that point there
The spot memorable as it was a outcrop

'they they would fall down land here

'git-ur-shit
'lets-go
half-mile down
Jordan full-lecture on how to spot a trail

Letcure for the first time admired as master
This master himself humbled by the simple genius 
Accumulated in the experience of the like of Jordan

Jordan found the spot
Then they traced the trail step-by-step

Water-ditched all-in so was the courage of this boy
Return no water meant public-death

Buckets left only the pole
Post used to allow the boy to conquer better than deer

Step to step
Once Jordans rules all simply practiced boy satisfied

Another drop down put them at the entry point
Enter quick by the retreat long

'likely only done past night
'hell deez a smell ya so quick

'obvious night time never gonna get seen

Jordan put him on the most poputlated path to get down to warmth
Night long descent put them in a meadow 

Boy able to sleep at midnight warm valley below
Hike back up & refill the buckets to begin

Exodus of a people from slavery

Jordan was a cocky-muthrfkr the next weeks after
He swore his skills for tracking grew 100-fold after waking
_

Dunes at ocean of transient-energy
Hut staurated with passionate bloom of seasonal-energies

Tabacco of this Witch's leave fused with methol 
Thick sweet cloud perfect for ring-wars

Zone energies thrived in Jewels invigorated presence
Champions bloomed all in the coranation of the new witch

Third night without sleep
All left of witch consumed in mind 

~no energy
~energy equal quantum-pure

Jewels summoned the Witch
Boiled flower & herbs inside couldron 

Audible-phantasm-aun-boys-heard
Wicked rasps of power 

iss cowerd in her nest
Boys huddled together 

Boys ordered outside into the dark-night
Jewels weilded a two faggots
Handed one to Jordan & Todd 

~ witch bones in the well 
~ Ben help lower Jordan down

Ben looked at her

'Do not ask this of me

Jewels repented

~no sorry

~you doing it

Ben immediately launched into well

Jewels wanted to remind him to aim for the dark-spots
But he should know that by now-right

Jordan achored Ben with a rope to help with the fall

Ben via GriGri descented down

Yuck-of-narrowness of forever-dank-places
Centuries old civilizations & dominions
Upset by this unprecdented-passage of Ben

Ben almost water level caught of eye in moon-light
Yellowed bones stuck inside stone-wall
Buried as if climbed up on own volition

Ben forced to kneel down to collect all the teeth
A fine-sand-bed made the search certain

Jordan tossed-down a-make-shift broom
To scrub the well-moseleum-bottom 

Half-heartedly
Only that one-soaked-water over a week
 
A pyre erected over the mudpit in the middle of the field
Bones full of tumors now burnt to dusk 

Ashe planted in soil of the greenary

~ she not teach me
~ only  her burial
~ now gone forever

iss explained

~ oh she taught you 
~ enough already
~ you bless-god & give-thanks

Tomes two sided 
Each the crest of her celestial-sisters

Equals each her to other

Both passed in the manner of flame
Under full moon

Lonely hermit endowed fondness for the fortune of burial of friend
Impossible in circumstance other-wise

Decades of wander alone 
Accompanied back to dust of entropy
_

Each in-the-shits due from a pecan-mostly-diet
Each gone farther than possible due to Jewels

uch passage of time
Before they would return

Wild herbs & pecan salads 
Jewels always kept pouches of oils & spices & herbs
She almost always made anything delicious 

Line-of-Felines  & Clusters of Mice instructed to duties
Principles passed down genereation to generation in royal line

Jordan worshiped by the mice who repaired his gear with lesssons of embroidery learned
ice vests that proved the position of the mouse in society

Felines mixed over generations with a great many lost-cats 
Pets taken by owners too-close to river
For-ever stranded down-river

Lost & terrified pets assimilated into a hill infested by cat-harems

Packs of the females ferocious
Idle males muscular yet Scooby-Doo cuddly
_

Chores
Water-plants hunt-bug
pick-n-dry-n-store 

Chores cats tho distracted constantly managed eventually to complete
Even if act took a week
Enlongated to serve their pride & meaningless days

Chores mice took on immediately
Eager to resume business-as-usual of mousey-life
.
.
.
Starved of food burst in on a camp-site
Look like all escaped from jail

Friendly-gathering easily took in the pack
Fed & drunk gluttonous after dire-necessity

Locals to Corpus offered ride back out truck-bed

// Dropped under hot sun 
// No-where-cross-roads

// Stuck 5 hours midway at the next hitch
// Back in Corpus by night 

ck to the Dunes crashing waves beat welcome 
Waves beat in welcome crashes against the rock-out-cropping-of-rocks perimeter of Dunes
Splashes truly warm greeted them in reunion

Next days only light sun & chilly relaxation
Cold wind came by & blew over
_

Scotty led broke-skaters a mini-group of scavangers

The newest annoyed Jordan
Scotty punished them with a supply-run

Obligated by the simple fact

'Where else can you sleep & chill tonight

Five grateful poor-bastards from Miller High
Krew grateful for hands to prepare Friday-Pre-Dagon-Eve-Party

Bluen moonshine from the Bluff 
Drunk straight it glowed-green-tint 

DJ Ryder pulled up 808s & trucks
Alone his three truck entourage called all to party

Drawn deep as center city

Local krews from all regions present
Skaters bladers bikers punx dealers rednecks thugs
United where attendance defined legit each equal other

Party wild till dawn 

Jewels spiked the drink to morph the moonshine a color deep purple

Ben signed titties & had a super-star-night
Father of a worldwide network originated here hometown 

Prep for this party USB depleted world-markets 

Party named USB 

USB or you dont get in
Each left with a bootable-unix USB

Todd & Jordan & Jewels all envious of Ben
Especially Jewels who expected to have attention
Or atleast most of it but never none of it

Ben dawned as a White Rabbit 
Pick-of-the-litter adored him 
Floppy-bunny-ears & floppy-titties

Dagon Eve a region-wide mandatory-holiday 
Open-celebration along bayfront highway end-to-end

Pagan ritualistic sacrifice-feast
Endeared-centuries-tradition

Animal roasted on spic-over-barrel-fire
Carved as chosen-member of the social-unit 

Honey & chili-based meat-glaze 
Unique family-heirloom-recpie

Chosen-member draped in semblance of animal
ore nude for better time a well of a good-time
Help the community endure hard-long-years

Home-brew-beers central to festivities
Lightness of heart bubbled by South-Texan hops

City entire over age of thirteen out bay-walk rain-or-not
Long & open bay front street sectioned-off for festival 

Grill-pits flamed center-road
A peaceful-time local-to-local

Sections of the bay held long-standing-reputations span past-generations
Each pit the pride of a social-unit this year to gain fame & the best titties

Fishy-overtones-of-spice unsettled strangers & gwakers 
Ritual symbolism another odd-repellent of non-locals

Roads shut-down as final detterrant for strangers
Gawking-instigator-tourist favored by stampede-of-children

special
An unspoken byword  year-round

Children swarmed together
Adults dare not interfere

obs infested entire blocks of street
Raided pills like candy

Drug-stores kept carved-pumpkins full of pills front doors in a tithe lest incur damage
Intricacy of detail to assuade rambunctions children delight in smashing-pumpkins not glass

aniacal-craze of drugged-up kids moved monolithic cloud
Children march triumphant in songs of blitzed-dominance

A certain child 

Appointed by inexplicable manners
Empowered to tag a target special

Waves & waves of minature-viciousness
Docile mask cast aside for this night

Faces painted by deamonic-embrance
Toddler till age of thirteen

Never resist the attack & shame
Reprisal against entire neighborhoods if a gunshot heard

Shooter's house burnt down
Ashes all them & close-kin
ultiplied out to neighbors

Return from festival to burnt-abodes
A lesson many well learnt last decade

Social-force kept all from being tagged special in neighborhood by noting-all-present
Bayside road alone the safe place to gather in the relief of security against a looming fear of children
_

Alley after dusk
Jordan set the tarps & locks over the bikes

Rustle of chains brought the attention of a patrol-policeman
PoPo lights blup demands for attention from the surprised-krew

'Hey what you doing back there

On instinct all jumped a wall into a multi-level-park-lot 
A second set of cops executed a close-in 

Forced to the terrible option of only ascending
Driven like cattle Jewels hoiseted them up levels

Four ran their asses off doomed layer after layer hopeless
Sound of the squeels of tires closer & closer

Obvious situation near empty lot

a small voice hissed

'ged-outta-here
'dont get us caught

Behind a parked-van emerged head-only of five huddled skaters from Miller

another voice wailed 

'police bank bail after arrests
'my moms a going to kill me for the bill

A final voice commanded

'shut tha fuck up Timmy

'you got them called
'breaking that window noob

Light drew out Shorty from the shadows

'oh-hella-yeah-yall 
'Jewels

Saved kid-in-distress startled by the look of distress left on Jewels face

'You can just like obliterate the cops all HeMan
'right?

Jordan front-in to step off the fool

'2 cars plus backup
'We are all trapt

'We got chased here
'Yall dumbass hid here

Dick-head not back

'Hey we good 
'We chill here

'Yall go get arrested
'They aint seen us

A little freshman spoke-up
About to lay down wassup

'Yall chill
'check-this 

No where to go & the PoPo around the corner
Immediately all submitted to the plan of the freshman
_

PoPo out car on floor just-below
Side-by-side they walked up ramp 

Out here his far these were their victims

Larger cop cursed

'fuck quotas Gary can suck my nutts
'like his wife did
'when she drunk-drove last year

Partner agreed

'These brats are gonna pay

'Tell-you-me
'I want a second shot if she gets chosen this year

'Before she turns 40 

10+ in one voice yelled

'SSPPPPEEEEEHHH
'SCCCCIAAALLL

Congradulations & aundulations 
The freshman now titled The Freshman

Ben told Shorty

'ping bounty x 1000 
'put word out tonight

'many new nodes legit-rich

Jordan put in solid interupt

'Get them $KEY buyers lit

Wordless Shorty ended the convo

'oh we gonna be hot on dat
'sure-thang

Shorty invited at Ben the UnderNET king

'My hoods have the best salooloah-dogs
'Come & tell everyone yourself 

'Get hype up 
'People see Ben & Jewels there

'I got this cuz hella-set
'shit-son Jewels promise
'all-yall want me help hook-up

Jewels audibly turnt from second-mention

Ignorant Shorty oblivious

Jordan tried to shift focus for Ben's sake

'Tonight we break into Driscol
'Gonna flash Uni Hospital

'By the time Uni realizes
'Nodes will be worth too much to turn down


The Freshman displayed his pack of cans

'Damn the Uni 
'Ballsy

His pack displayed cans of assortment

'ohhh dude
'we could all tag it yea-ah

Dickhead smacked Freshman in back

'You will seriously go with them
'Go 
'Let me see 
'Get on 

Dickhead fronted him

'Yeah kid think before you speak

'Alright Jewels & rejecks

'Imma hit me up

Dickhead shouted from the otherside of the ramp entrance

'Me & my cuz run by Uni on way back tonight
'Chill there on a case of iced-40oz

'Yall need help
'Just gotta yell real loud

'We will throw you a beer

Fateful tree & familiar ledge
Exposed to Downtown for that brief moment

Catch-breath on the adrenaline
All-out for all to see

oon in a bright glow
No lights to the shadows

Shadows kept off the sun
Shadows kept one hidden

Todd unlocked the window
Neatly all entered to obscurity of shadows

Driscoll derelict under the Uni
Familiar halls turnt haunted

First stop Jordan's locker
Extreme-other-end-of-school

Lust-lost-fervor a torch in the darkness to keep courage
Carnage left from the riots to the Hunt

Not quiet on the empty halls

A light sprang on far-faint-down-opposite-end
Krew froze Miss attuned her listening device

! HEARD
! SUM
! TIN

She near let out an abombidably-loud-scream
Jewels predictive-hands clasped the cry silent

A giant shadow clambered about

Thick door raised from the stairwell
Light bore fantastic shadows into the wall across

Shadows warped the head too tiny for so great a body
A enourmous torso wearing a diapers with a gnarly hook

Loud yet more subtle voice echoed

! DAGON

! EVE

! DIM
! WIT 

Shadows departed quick as appeared

Jewels 'whispered' angrily

~ gdmit-fk-it
~ told yall
~ shut-the-fk-up
_

Locker & Jordan fk-all

Fits of elation in unencumbered-desire-unleased in full ravish of the Giant Panda Bear
Panda Bear authentic Japanese & so finely made that most people would fk-that-panda

Action quicker than any could turn away 

Jordan humped the dust off it
Till it clean now him covered

Over as quick as it begun

Streams of sweat ran down proud-panting-happy-face
Panda tied around his pack in a giant hug

Jordan said coyly in an out-of-character-voice 

'GPB

'You were right to believe
'I would one day rescue you

Jordan shat on metaphysics
Except if in any way substantialized personification to GPB

(or any other omens he wore like pendants)
_

Down the halls back towards the hallway
Closet with the printer set up by Ben to crack the key

Todd mello since morn

Girl who shit-so-bad & his foot dunked in it
He definitely wished her dead in curses
Torment of a day with shit-in-shoe

He saw her
aybe
Well felt like her & that is enough

estration blood of girls
Blood he naively took as rust

Patients blood from blood layered on elevator cords
Young Women & teachers devoured in a lust that left a mark

Consequence to his actions
Todd to himself thru the fiasco Jordan & now Ben created
_

Now down the halls back towards the hallway
Closet with the printer set up by Ben to crack the key

Closet-door opened expelled compressed-air-thick-in-chemicals

Ben raised his skank over his nose
He patted Jordan thankful on his back

Algorithmns in the code proved sound  
Faith strong into a mania this step must-happen

Krew off to themslves at other ends of the hall
Ben this anxious flips-a-bit guranteed
(oddly in victory the fit is worse)

Jordan off to himself
high-way pleasure-lane-reunion-bay
_

Long-passage thru cleaning instruments 
Sweat of nervous-energy to Ben's brow

Ben reached the end
Behind where stairs descended
In-darkness hands found the printer

Ben caught of heart
Nothing had printed

Panic-auto-pilot-hands fumbled open the paper tray
Paper-tray found empty & that fact-slapped-face

An error of life had failed
not his algorithmn 

In that he must find some light
But he only found himeself alone in darkness

ben-bit-flipt

Printer flung here & there til it was no-where-mostly

A heavy cartiedge fell to a soft-thud
Fall softened by-layers-of-paper

Ben found one to lift up

White paper glowed in darkness
Dark sane patterns obvious 

Paper after paper
Proved same pattern

Hundreds identical
Proof after time-stemped proof

Ben's embarassed apology quick
Each he gave stacks of paper

'I am under lotta stress

'alright-fk-yall
'lets-go-im-ready

Ben herded them to continue on
Each give a stack of paper

'Guard these with your lives
_

To the tunnel door hard to open

Jordan struggled more than at any lock-pick
Submitted to handsigns & only then able to work-it-out
Larger more rudimentary-picks used genericly worked-it
_

Up the tunnel cords below to an aybss
Trick to wipe them for blood on ascent past first two levels of the Uni

Skipped the first two floors of patients

'Add these new $KEY headers to all our INIT

INIT meant a usb loaded to flash a computer into a unix node on the Undernet

usr-initiates host to the network
host-initiate fills usb with $KEY

net banks pay out $KEY

usr -> usb -> intiates -> host
host -> usb -> $KEY -> usr

Krew released into the easter-egg-hunt

Rebuild the kernels of the network was only a plug-in & reboot

Hive-mind-survelient-system used against itself
Key allowed total interception & manipulation of traffic

Anonymous-only traffic based upon encrypted p2p web
Kernels critical nodes attached to the Undernet automatically

Order's great mission to replace nodes would swiftly give way to the power inherint in privacy
onths of rewiring & the ability to rework all computers individually to the old ineffienct network

Traffic One-Time-Only-Pre-Share-Keys-Anonymous tunnels
Bandwith of traffic improved 100-fold

Nodes contracted traffic to be proxy by other nodes
Aun still 10s times faster than old network
///////////////////////////////////
_

All now easily picked locks as experts

Network wires a simple trace to the network-box
These gateways the magic place to insert & reboot

Flash of unix kernel took several minutes

Todd stopped front a framed-photo on a desk
LOCHNAR 

Displayed in the penthouse of the building

Two hours enough for several floors
Now the krew powered behind his plan

In elevator joined to rise to the Pent-house
Jewels hasitily hit the penthouse-button

Ben & Jordan too late in their admonishion
Elevator locked up in an alarm

Ben hacked at the controls

After sudden-drop, he swears non-leathal

Elevater began a sane ascension

///////////////////////////////////////////////

/////////////////////////////////////////////

An enourmou-expanse-of-black-hardwood-floor bordered a large pond off-center
Soft white sand beached a small island center pond 

Penthouse ceiling opened-up to the night sky
Salty winds of the ocean massaged skin

A long dark form lay o'r a dark-purple-boulder
A tail bobbed like iritated-cat

LOCHNAR resonated a green light to hum energy on the septer in hand of the laid creature
Orb in a song of light to first startled hum then into ejaculated pulsaion of energy

Enraged in the energies of a betrayed-betrothed a monster in jealous-charge

Screechs heraled the charge thru water to deck

'Miss so you have returned
'With Jewels the Treasure of Ebb-ave-lee

'We will guard skin after tonight

A form on the hardwood-deck thought to be driftwood sprung to life
Enlongated as it rose submereged mostly in the water

Giant 10m monster

Open penthouse gave room for gallant-charges 
Youth ready to end this ancient evil too long the villian

Giant hissed all too quick for a first-look

'Prophecy calls Jewels here for sacrifice

Certain to match its thick bones in a one-swipe-head-butt 
The first beached-creature bull-charged the krew

Frieght-train shut down 
crack-crack-crack...

Spinal columns snapped as Jewels met the collision full-force-heave Tome front

Creature now broken unable to move its mass 
Tauren-creature mer of the mar

Scaly long centipide of sections

Humans reworked into mechanism
Brains tucked into ribs 
Eyes replanted into shoulders
Chest to chest with the next
One long intestine connected to-top-ribcate-out-bottom-to-enter-next

uscular arms with hands reshaped
Armored in ancient-ways of master-craft

Eyes open curiously desperate to get a good-view
Now mostly paniced to the paralysis of state

Upper body of tauren Naga oceanic
Torso-elongated as to put it on all fours for the charge dragged by lower-body

Rule one on Earth:

Fish stick to sea-fights
amals stay to ground-fights

Fish pampered
Cocky off its countless feeds

Kids hardened by seaons of toil & competition

Chain-n-lock swung remorseless by Jordan
Be-dazzeled-god-piece Todd's hammer
Crow-bar weilded Ben
Jewels unstruck Tome from pampered-face

///////////////////////////////////////////
All laid into the Seer until sashimi layed out
Flesh rich from life lived without want

None could deny a chew-or-two
Todd clutched the scepter of the LOCHNAR
To fulfill prophecy
LOCHNAR obiedient slave
//////////////////////////////////////////////

Giant lept now defeated last-dash to puncture a giant dark-sack
It hung as penthouse-centerpiece

Black-fog erupted like damned-water 
Darkness enveloped all in a sea

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Todd able to direct his chi to sever the non-native-portal
Native can not open portals on native realm
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Tentacled arms long & barnacled probed Jordan
Instant to snatch him calculated

Lock-n-chain countered the attack
yet thick-barnacles sliced into his skin

A ink load hit half of Todd & Jordans right-leg
The ink burned yet not as bad as Hut Poison

Air now saturated in a darkness as a thick fog
Swift-movements dispersed it to momentary-clarity 

After recalculated damage from Jordan's strike
Tentacle whipt away

Jewels open-tome fanned all aside in great measures

A long crusted sword-fish-nose exploded into cloud of foggy mucus & blood
Fish fell down in a painful-rage of the quasi fog-water

Fog cleared to reveal a great host of the most awesome
All around trasnported to some malevolent-ocean-world

//////////////////////////////

Giant composed of a chain of torsos
Ribcage & Arms stiched in muscles as a snake

Bottom of ribcage wout feed out the neck connected to the next-ribcage
Skin of it a milky-softness of a new-born the rosy aspect of it unsettling

Some had noses others none
Noses clustered like mushrooms individually-sniffed-interested

Sitching required for this form done with fine-precision

Each arm honed to perfection
Each of the nails curated-in-paint with artistic nacissistic finesee

Arms moved & acted independently
But the whole driven as a catepillar

//////////////////////////////

All gripped by tentacles & flung tumbles-different-directions

Lobster-claw bit hard into Ben's thigh caught him mid-air

Jules & Todd countered the momentum of the throw
Tome cracked a Lobster-shell to give space to land 

Fear of the scene froze the region 
Jewels & Todd able to find ground

Darkness under starlight clear deep-night
Todd with the green-glow 
Right hand held the scepter

Todd did not recall when he took the sceptre
Chesire Cat flung tail to the limits of his periphreal

A voice surrounded Todd in the darkness

'You haunt my dreams?

'muha

'HaHAH

Breath now palpable against Todd's face
Nightmare face the source of the tentacles

'I am this worlds Dagon Image
'You the gate into your world

Dagon Image called out to all

~Nightmare to nightmares
~Sacrifice of Five


~Feed

Darkness of monolitich movements



A pack of hammer-head-sharks discovered at Todd's flank

Todd trusted his Passanger
A jump towards foremost hammer-head to dig bedazzeled-god-piece into flesh for a leverage up

Trajection of hammer-heads now put them on a turn-about 
Blinded by the rage of the humiliated leader

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
A darkness-blanketed-the-darkness in a forboarding pulsation-of-movement
White Noise a great cloud of tiny carnivorous fish 

Todd balled aganist a sea-plant
Gripped & pulled into the leaves

A shriek escaped him when his hairs charged
Plan shot out a electric pulse to fry the fish dead

Already dead is a much juicier choice for the hungry masses
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Hammerhead intercepted by Tome of Jewels swing
Leaderless troop retreated yet able to catapult Jewels near Ben 

Countless movements gave way to dodge the bouldered girl & her Tome
Ben caught upper-body by a big-headed-squid suction-cups ripped off-skin

Jewels made quick work of both lobster & squid
Now accustomed to the quasi-air-water

Great gasps as a shameful whimper escaped Ben 
Jewels slung Tome on back & cradled Ben

Instantly robbed of position now entrapt by awaited tentacles

Arched-form-of-a-woman illuminated in agony of electricution lit 360 as moon

Jewels stripped-naked & held in electrocution
Freckles burned in red-lights

Long clear flosfloresant tentacles gripped each part of her
Synced the shocks in pulsation

Jewels lit up in another great berth of agony
She awoke again to life

Cherry red crab-spider black crustation in the sharp points of King Crab
Fangs of thick saliva glowed to reveal terribleness

Spider shot out a thick-web-line as a whip
Web snatching a cluster of tentacles put the entire section out-of-sync

Next electrocution fumbled defenseless against a vindictive Jewels 

Jewels only too keen on the ways of pain
Explored all the nooks & crannys of of this Image till death

Spider, Ben & Todd aided noteworthy
Jewels carried tween Ben & Todd

Spider-crab here-till-ignored now needed to be dealt with
Here-fore-which careful non-verbal interactions not to ruin the good-vibes

Todd decided to ignore the Spider-crab in resolution

'We must find Jordan
'We only leave together

Jordan greeted popped out-under the Spider-crab shell

'sk-my-stinkies

Jordan replied to the amazement

'Dont ask me how 
'Passagers huh
_

Todd now as if possesed focused his chi to draw open a portal
All step back to their world

Late night penthouse 
Broken centerpiece hung over-head

Giant no where to be found
_

Two lower floors down they hid into a restroom

A familar scuttle passed-by 

Endurance of the trial of the moment past life-long-limits

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Bomb spewed out pepper-smoke into its face as mace
Eyes buldged into a visible painful reaction

Great torso double-mule-kicked
It flew into the glass shattering shards

Shards which sliced & stabbed it on the way down
Skanks up but room too small they dragged Jewels out

Now familiar with the structure they found a dummy-waiter as expected
Two at a time they hoisted down to the floor above the school
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Uni followed identical security protocol as Driscol
Krew managed to maneuver down the floors till they found a suitable shute

Landry-shute an out-of-play enjoyable-landing had it not been coated in
piss shit blood semen vomit

Jordan opened up conversation

'At least it soft

Ben looked back at him

'You have a torn finger-nail stuck below your left-eye 

Todd looked out the window

'We are on the East Side
'Just-bull-rush to the west-side

Get out the window adjacent to the tree
_

Jewels front-frieght-train

wheel-chairs-strew over
fk-the-world 
all pushed out of the way

Sirens in a blaze

One tough nurse known as Bus
Stays on the first floor for heavy-work

Jewels had one sure option
She stepped up the fire-extinguisher
Lept to other-side-of-wall
Sprung off into a full-kick-tween-shoulder-neck

Bus didn't have much of a neck
Kick slipped top to skull-crush-head

Jewels unstuck herself from mass-of-body toes-suspended all held by half a face
Accident only to be digested later 

Exit of Uni impossible from front
Doors more secure than a bank

Uni Hospital gets its money
Easy-way or hard-way

Jordan always to quick to catch
Dove in the doctor candy-stash

Late he got up to them

Todd in righteous flame burned at him
'There is no entrace to the shaft

Jordan accusative fast
'Then just make one

Jewels got the axe 
By then they were surrounded

Hopital thugs in redemption of Bus

Jordan's chain-n-lock spun to whurls
Behind Tood & Ben who backed-up Jewels 
2 axe-lengths behind

Jewels had and axe & proven to not have restraint
Short-stout-man called her bluff into a charge

Impossible to miss him but the axe have to split him 
Two as second-round filled the large hall

Jewels butt to skull & over flew
She came down axe lurched back

Two had only panic
Turing opposite direction
Each into their wall
In such a lurch to smash-into-then-back
Broken-nose to broken-nose

Jewels kicked into each chest in a stop & flip back
Bloody boulders cannonballed the mass behind

Short-man called cards on a bluff

Jewels only all in & in the sacred fire of all Ginger women everywhere
She landed from the flip careful to avoid the pools of blood

ean-time boys in desperation to open the wall
Two others looked at the LOCHNAR sceptar

Only then did Todd realize even had the thing
Carried until now without his knowldege of picking it up
Like he entirely forgot about it

Todd now compelled to use its power
Todd began to eminate in green-glow

Jordan impatient
'WTF good a light gd-mit

Todd approached & parted the wall
aterial now erased for them walk thru into the shaft to Driscol

Critters in swarms filled the sound of that shaft
One of many shafts that went as pipes
_

Inside the closet-door 
Patrols of mosters teemed

All jittery with empty-stomach
Fresh meat a savor once a decade

Patients let their savage-side take over
ania may enter in the process of surgery-attached-assimilation

Royal-Forces to rich-kid
Human aquatic a patch-work

Appendage corrupted in a spasm of muscle over decades
Body now strunked to sustain the added-appendage

Noses like trunks with a tiny body
Legs & arms reattached to support orafices which always leaked acidic-mucus

onster in a lumber towards them

Jordan in a moan
'fk-all-holy
'three floors of this shit

Lumber of redistributed organism sickened sanity

!!! POW

Top-left-chunck-of-nose obliterated in a red puff
A hairy clump smacked the floor in fron of them

A man down the hall dragged himself with his only arm
His legs chewed off all wounds seared.

He crawled in an escape in complete shock
'we come for you
'to take & lock-up

'monsters hit the main group
'when they too far

'i went in with the rest 
'to save my cousin

Guy baggled on helpless

He had one bullet left
They chould not help him so they just left

Bloody trails led to a room
otion a clusterfk of smacks & breakage

Five crossed it very carefully
onsters unintelligble-one-from-other busy

Bodies all in different stages of carnage
Crawler had snuck from here but there is no escape

Flesh chewed or carefully-slices to reattach to themself
A Nose front a pile of fingers
Hands busy attaching them in a train to support the front
_

Only blood streaks until the first floor
Dead monsters & cartel after hard-won-battle 

Clean up krew returning with orders to secure a hallway window
Both groups met at a corner-face-smash

Scoritaur upright head but horizantal torso
Spine to ass-hole connected into a mega-spine
Tip a wicked-bone worn into an axe

Backed off & then snaped back-bone
Backbone snared by a chain
Lock end caught something in a heave he scrunched it
Todd lauched Ben up who came down in a double-stop

Spinal columns exploded-out
Bones now protruding where monster-faces-were

Tail end un-aware until it too late
Jewels Tome held in a twirly full-body-swing
Splattered a bulbous creature against lockers
ess after-wards could honestly have been anything

Distraction blew off the heads of the rest
Cartel armed with guns they spotted

Julio came up to them 
A expression of shock
Whatever in the past clearly of no import
'chinga-tu-madre-whey
'more these assholes
! desde-alla no podemos salir
ortally wounded as the others & hysterical

Dead vatos both a blessing & a curse
Countless monsters now dead yet a swarm stirred
Latent pools of energy pooled by containment unleashed

Unleashed hordes now bounded out & up hospital floors
_

Todd remebered the dark visage had whispered
'more fate demands you to answer me
'fate will deman me to answer you

Caught quick as humans are weak
Scepter taken & able to see clear

Friends all surrounded despite Jordan's ingenuity
Allowed to take friends & leave thru a specific portal
Given back the sceptar

Fuzzed off as a high 
Low came just after long-glide

Vessel carried by his friends until this moment
Todd handsign to regain complete focus

Todd took the time to explain this
Without guiding principles dilemnas 

Group yet to give an answer
Rumbles of earth-quakes shuddered the bay

Death of the Seer
Staff long-since-dead
onsters released from cell
Barrier broken in a damn

Aun Jewels stampeded-to-death if they not stay there 
Restroom with the longlasting remains of Julio & Emilio

Vent of First Communication exploded into Todd's hands as a relic
Creatures single-vision-escape by-passed them hid in the stalla

Todd knew certain they alone released the seed of Dagon to be spread to the world
Schrodinger Cat tho intelligent & insipid must put a father where there is offspring 

LOCHNAR a deep well of cosmic energy emitted by a soul or star
Todd a vessel chosen to breach barrier

Guiltless as he did not control his actions for some time
Todd to become Dagon egg to hatch in time as cosmic-portal
Entity to jump thru to birth vessel in this reality 
_

Jordan tied Julio & Emilio together around Jewels
They smacked each other in unwanted kisses
But the only buffers to full-frontals at the moment

Entire section of the building obliterated
Acidic silme as lava
Shoes half-melted to an unstoppable corrosion 

ade their way to industrial
If they helped everyone needed they'd gotten-no-where

No to survive at times
It is only certain few with ability
Honor to a debt to live-for-all

By time they able to save someone
Out in industry all still vacant 
_

In war men face themselves as monsters
Now man faced a monster without perception
Horror an infinite question of pain in reality

LochNess out to skyline burned-down any govt-weapon
Flame a demonic corrosion unlike fire known

Tentacles streched miles thru pipes over streets
Intelligent eyed appendages struck in percisions of muscles past milenium
_

Two types of monsters prodominant
WereFishes & Companies

WereFish
Aquatic-material converted onto human-creatures

Company
Human-material converted onto an aquatic creature
No longer human only a human appendage in a great-machine
echanical nodes to a conglomerate government

Loved ones ficious beasts
onstrosities stop dead hearts

Humans splayed then stuck spine
Anesthesia put people high as fk

Disassemled carefully craftsman
Attached to monster at workbench 
Would work over an emotional victim

Laugh Cry Moan
whatever you wanted
Only at a hysteria
Anesethesia past pain

Visible fissures opened
Portals lead thru 

Entire bay infected
Friends devoured at best
Seen in operation at worst
_

onsters + Conversions 
Exponetial growth fed more portals 
.
.
.
Ninjas on mission to find princess
Attracted by the smoke-bomb skills of Jewels 

Fight at what the world decided containment-only
Ignore a small wound in prayer it all go away

People still went there day-to-day for work
9-5 Time of day fish sleep & safe until 8

Companies now setteled on some land 
ind at the new homestead to build their village

Areas easily avoided as neither wanted interaction
Shame of seeing a relative stressful for-entire-schedule

Dive to jump thru fissures
Portals empowered on lunar cycle
30 day limits set on treasure-hunt

Portals to worlds sacked by Dagon
Fish out spoils for the taking

#################### PREFACE #
##############################

Ethusiastic pack of boys 
Singular vision of Mayhem

Downtown monolithic on vacant-streets

Bill was one of the more effeminate
Tone in well-worn-adoration perked with curiosity

'HP you never promote your tales
'We all know you-re timid

'snap-of-fingers

'you could be
'just-as

Bill sang out in a dance
Secret hope to mesmerize HP to keep uncurled

~or-even-richer
'Than all of us

Nearer to HP undaunted all encircled
Prescense literally like a torch

HP face under spotlight of all

Bill added reassuring

'No one I have past on your tales 
'nor-any-of-us

Bill led the others to agree
Each a nod with remebrace of personal-meomory

'Have EVER
'Heard anything remotely-incriminating

'IN ALL OUR LITERARY CIRCLES

Jeff long-winded gateful-to-get-off-chest 

'No-gimmick 
'No critique
'Ever once been able
'To stand-against you in the slightest-notion

Bill had laid the groups confusion all out on an HP taboo-subject
Years of aquaintanceship here-to-fore none-dare-breach

Timidity curls the spirit for the party as a whole
A known-social-group HP for the first-time led

oon high & ready to unmask any non-truth on HP's face

Graveyard in keen shadows outside silence
oon beams & sound ocean-breeze 

Ript off typical-day-routine to a night fantastic

HP hand-full of grave-stone just-chipt
Incriminate all to a fiendish-act

Crime recorded multiple times on HP record
Secret he above-all-else wished kept hidden

HP unable to retreat
Forced to lay open bare his situation

'a master knows when he is a master

Bill accusative wanting no run-around

'so you always say

'dis-aint-horse-trade-yall

HP waited for the mood to resettle after Bill's impatient judge

Tide of emotional-states-of-pack
Weilded by his power thru power of Moon

'My universes 
All my literary creations are real

'Far-off-galaxies
'Fill void the black-of-vacancy

'They shine 
'I see them twinkle 

'Aun from here

Bill wanted a concrete answer

'Where at
'You see them now?

HP in act of unprecedented physical-intimacy
oved behind Bil

His arm adhered to HP's elongated-arm
Point-out a cluster of stars with elongated-fingers

HP in a whisper of a treasured secret
All others bent in close

Compeled to be attached to the moment in all intimacy deeper than gravity

'I will blink

'Those stars will blink

None questoined only watched in pyramid 
Long-finger apex which all held in view of HP's face

HP blinked

Bill said incredulous
All-else caught-aun-frigtened-terribly

'One blinked Blue
'THE OTHER RED!

Bill let himself be caught-of-heart

Silence HP patiently waited-on

HP distanced himself walking away
Leading pack of possible-criminals 
Away from the scene of the crime
Into shadows of the ancient-church
Centuries since last buried here

Crime HP literal hands muddied-with-evidence
The newbie pist on the youngest grave

~piss-on-upper-class

Excused-now HP had promptted spontaneous-desecration

HP spoke now back to them
All-too-familiar enviornment

Gothic architecture
Overlayed by twilight tomes

shameful-sneak-out-undected

Adrenaline potent-natural-spike
Truly-treasured yet all-too-rare recieved

'What I write comes to pass

'Wealth 
'A home

'Naught sparkle
'When I blink

Response of reverent silence
Grateful for the treasured answer of an oft-asked-question
Here-to-for only vague-illusions

Before parting the grounds
Last of the honest paid-out

'What I love
'Troubles me most
.

Jordan called her over

'You are handsome
'Why ya stuck always
'To the shadows
'Like a think pole
'Only part of dreary
'Landscape of death

All mezmerized
5 Men NYC cemetery
Under Full Moon

Anxious for response
Bought by such
Beautiful poetry

Praise which all knew
HP Lovecraft mortal-weakness

Last of aristocratic line 
Faced him under bright moon-light

'You are a negroe

Tone typical HP dismisive

Gentleman enough
To explain simply

'your people know little
'of what is beauty

Other three had to plead
HP to stop the wails
For fear of police 

Boyfriend demanded self-righteous
HP complied good-hearted

'you are the center of attention
'in every room
'more where people more famous

'chill-da-fk-out-yo
'certain words hurt

'but you got to realize
'when they are not true

HP Lovecraft finished
Front a nobel-gallant-tombstone
Pose perfected alone front mirrors

He had many thousand servants
To help service Turtle-King
Fulfill deal 7 pleasure

Prime Order
House Party met both
Roy Miller toothless shark

Turtle-King kindly
Cared for Roy

Honestly the servants
Did most of the work

Truthfully
All they did was

Do drugs with bitches together
Todd had to kick Roy Miller's ass
He is drunk obnoxious
Characteristic of too-rich-wealthy
Jewels knew what strings to pull

King-Turtle broke up the fight
iss & Jewels invited previously

For an unknown reason
Both screw-with-the-boys

True reason was
An ass-kick-kept

which later nearly got them killed
Jordan's advice blown off
that it was a bad-bike-to-roll-with
.
.

Jewels irate she didn't have a new tongue Miss replied tartly
'Tongues don't just grow-for-the-pickings

'Where am I to get a suitable source & workstation
'A local hobo'I dont want herpes  'I get it every-time
.
.
.
Cats everywhere except around Todd They had their own, quicker, narrower paths to the shed
Jules exchanged with each of the cats Pimping new cats nightly each arriving with offerings

Her gifts of friendship Mixtures of feline perfume Jewelry & cat apparel
Cakes to fill with energy For sex, strength, intelligenceOr skull-fkd-delight

Once-decimated-ranks rapidly grew & grew itch focused on control of the cats via orders
Jewels expanded on it with ways to grow mutual interaction

Jewels never kept from work  From creation of brews, mixutures, herb-dehydration

'Always more wise & powerful versions of ourself'They who know us as we truly are in objective perspective
'Each is their own-worst-enemy'Each in an Order of Ourself
'Symbols associated daily 'With their emotional attachment'These are the armor of the soul
.

Todd deep respect

Total forgiveness
Cats that shamed
His parents 
Devaluation less
Kibbles-&-Bits

Preferred eventually
3 Bags eaten thru clean

Ben flaged that waypoint
In case he ever 
anages to wander that way
