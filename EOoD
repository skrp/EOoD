Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers that lined empty-halls

15 Minutes past the Bell
That point-of-no-return to class

Any student this late would get writ-up
Ironically worse than not arriving at all 

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail

His purpose was in the basement
To the door he planned to open

Latency becomes mounted by endless-anticipation
That energy from day-dreaming now as a hurdle
Aun compelled him towards the opposite direction

The thump of Todd's feet steady 
Step after step up stairs to higher floors

It was a peace appreciated in a place only-ever bustling-loudly
The few rays of the sun bore thru only to show the amount of dust in the air
_

The mellow ambience shattered as patters of run'n feet charged towards his direction from around the corner
Fortune had placed Todd directly opposite of the girls restroom

The distance was leapt in one bound and he rushed to the last stall
He let out a cocky smirk of the ingenuity of hiding in the girls

!! KAK 

The cracked-seat broke plunging his left-foot ankle-deep into hour-old piss & shit
He caught his balance with his arms to save the other foot

The door quietly opened
Someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled yell came from the hallway 
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

!! BOOM 
Heavy legs near-cracked-the-door-in-half 

That unexpected fright broke unprecedented-pressure into full-release

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSPPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP

The entire school vibrated with the overwhelming sound of a prolonged-volcano-blast 

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN YOU SHOULDA SAID WHY YOU NEEDED THE GIRLS 
One of the schoolhall-monitors hooted out for-the-entire-building-to-know 

The last of this announcement was gagged-quiet as gas particles bloomed-out in a thick cloud
_

The room was silent after the door fell shut and resettled
The building now seemed to rumble in a giggle 

!! PAT 
!! PAT 
!! PAT 

'Gonna make your fat-cunt-ass eat that shit you scabby bitch
Ben kicked at the stall door braced-shut by legs

'Back off
Todd stepped out of the stall

Ben turned to him even more crazed

!YOU   

'You are the reason I got chased

Todd was tackled to the wall 
Slaming hard as his wet foot slipped out

'walk'n around
'like you weren't skipping class
Ben muffled as he struggled out his revenge

'a teacher notified 
'the monitors and got me chased down 
Ben righteously continued

Todd manuevered around using Ben's force against him
Then with his forarms placed Ben in a locked-hold 

After several curses and a long pause Ben surrendered
'Alright asshole you made your point

Todd pushed Ben off to a safe distance
A toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that
Jordan blushed-out the awkward introduction
'Im sick

Today would haunt Ben's reputation a long time
For a while they were content with breathing the gas in silence 
_

Walls washed white layer-after-layer
Exentuated by the dark recesses between the tiles
Unable to conceal the deep-red of the grafitti symbols
That were easily visible when seen as a whole

Piss marked all to a feminine territory 
If only the stain but mostly the smell

Curiosity only met horrors 

Ben broke the silence 
'This place is kinda creepy
All of them had been repelled from investigations

High-hot-boxed in a room full of fumes
No where to go until the class period ended

A sound tickled Todd's ear
He moved closer to the wall

Todd was startled then reaffirmed
'There is a hum that sounds like a whimper
'Can you guys hear it

Jordan put in as he neared 
'Probably a ghost
'This school is hella haunted
He yelled at the trash-can playfully

Todd motioned them to the second-vent 
Next to the garbage-can

The rust smeared as Todd opened the lid for better acoustics
'It comes from this trash-vent

Suddenly Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

( need help help please help )

The sound came softened from great distance
But with a fullness-of-scream that rips apart throat-lining

The communication so faint Todd looked to the others for confirmation

( help us    please )

Jordan ventured  
'Here      
'we are here
'Where are you

( can you hear me  hello please help )

Jordan continued 
'We hear you
'We will get the Principal

( noooooooooooo ! )

The shriek took all three back in a tight terror

( they did this to her! )

Todd opened the lid with both his hands to shout down
'Who ever you are
'Where ever you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately, the others followed dazed 
To them it seemed a reckless promise

At 10-min-to-the-bell the hall is at its most empty
Policy prohibits anyone out-in-the-hall 

The trio made their way without obstruction 
The Monitors would be back in their lounge on the couch

'I discovered this door when I got lost my first-year fire-drill
'All year I been trying to work myself up to this before graduation 

Todd was the only-one-he-knew that had seen that long-corridor
Despite years he still believed in what he had seen

'I spent the past 2 years dreaming about exploring it
'Today is too much of a coincidence
'That door will lead us to her

They followed the stairwells down
Crossed lengths of halls of the first year students

Todd continued
'When I got lost 

'I felt someone calling out to me by-name 
'I followed tho less-than-a-handful knew my name

'I found a door at the end of the hall 
'It was unlocked
'I first peaked in only out of curiosity 

'At the back of the closet there was a lightsource instead of shadow
'I went in to see a long corridor
'The path went on for a long time 
'It ended at a black hole in a wall

'I am sure it leads down 
'But I forced myself to go back before I got near enough to know

Todd looked ahead determined
The pent-up-forces now-unleashed propelled him forward

Jordan stirred with the brisk walk expounded
'I did research on this school for all my papers
'This floor is suposed to be the basement

'Right so with that-in-mind
'There was one article of a peculiar-incident

'A boy was found brutally-seperated in a satanic-ritual
'The article said the incident was found out by the janitor
'The Recession took his home & he slept at school 

'The article mentions the location as the 3rd-Basement floor 
'That could be considered a typo caz there is only one basement

'But at the time there were only two levels
'University Hospital was built on top of the school 
'An entire decade later

Ben countered at the steamrolling logic
'I been here all 3 years of school

'If there was a sub basement there would be some proof
'A reworked stairwell that meets up with the other stairwells
'There would be left structural pillars

Ben's logic was solid but life seldom follows logic
'You both believe that a stairwell could just disappear
_

The exterior wall in the corner of the basement held a closet door
Todd's sweaty palms slid on the locked knob

A narrow closet was exposed by the small window

'Let me get this
Jordan knelt in front, took off his pack, and retrieved a pouch

The door was open and pack back on Jordan's back before the other two could follow the action 

Once inside the back after the brooms & mops
A corridor was revealed to turn down a very-long-hallway

The narrow corridor followed the exterior wall

They followed in the errie-way of knowing an action would change their life forever

Ben said as endorphins flowed into his brain in bounty of an oft asked question
'I always thought it was odd there were no small windows in any of the rooms on this floor
'So this is the real outer wall

The wall made of pilgrim-old-brick, large & thick
The bricks a dark-purple, like the color of space
_

The tunnel was bare and held no purpose
No back doors to any classrooms
It only continued long-passage-after-long-passage

The end came up as a blank wall

Ben chirp'd
'The architect must have been a comedian

Jordan countered
'Or a way to hide access to an entire level in a closet
'This bay was too huge to tame for early history

'Pirates frequently raided here
'Often they kidnapped children

Ben noticed on the old bricks
Symbols carved in peculiar diagrams 
The spraw of it was typical of angry graffiti

They came to the end
It was abrput as Todd had stated
But it had no hole nor door

Todd's nails scraped against the wall until he found an edge

Jordan moved him out of the way 
He went to work with a thin steel bar

The peeled-paint revealed a metal door 
2ft above-the-ground 3ft high-and-wide

Todd took the bar from Jordan & pryed open the hinges into a creaked submission
Somehow Todd always knew this went down & now he saw into the black depths

The door had the lock from the inside of this shaft
Smart for the pilgrims
_

Dark musty air flowed immedately to them strong-as-a-gulf-breeze
Something caught Todds eye
He poked at it with the bar

Elevator-cords hung in the mid hidden by darkness
'If there are 3 lower basements 
'Then there are two floors to explore

An exchange of glances agreed compliance

Jordan looked casual 
Ben looked like he would not back down

Todd reached with extended-arm and grasped the cord
In a hard pull he let himself be drawn into the darkness

Unexpectedly Todds hands began to slide 
He rapidly descended scream'n

!!OHSHIT
_

All was dark 
Distance only an abstract measurment

Movement was only testified by the-burning-of-his-palms
Sweat-sprung as his will-fought-for-his-life

Todd ventured his legs out 
He managed to stop himself into near splits

!!! TODD

The other two screamed frantically down

Todd looked up 
The door only a small sliver of light

'Im okay
'Im okay

'There is oil on the cords
'I should have expected it
'Gonna take off my shirt and use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

Ben asked automatically without idea on how to back up the offer
'Do you need help up

Todd fearless began to climb at a controlled rate
'Its best only one person be on the cord at the same time
'Im gonna try to find a door to get to the lower floors
_

Todd didn't notice any doors in the commotion down

The best course would be to climb up slowly to ensure he could get back up
He would feel for an open'n with this feet

The slide down had cleared off most of the oil
His hands now had clean purchase

The only sound was his breath and the swell of air
The gusts came intesnse rising with the heat-from-deep-darkness

Todd felt a gust on his stomach
It was cool & didn't come from below
He stomped out the outline of the door

! TWANG
! TWANG

A sliver beam bore into the darkness

'I think
'I think I found it

With one hand he felt for a handle
The door was there, he could feel the cold metal

!! POMP 
!! POMP 

Todd stomped the corner down 
He pulled himself higher kick'n down until the door gave way
He pulled himeself into the dusty grey hallway

'Im off the cords 
'Come down

'Wrap your shirt around your hands
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Ben & Jordan followed down and swiftly entered

Ben climbed inside scraping his knee
Looking up saw Todd and shrieked back falling-on-his-ass

! FUCK

Todd was covered in dusk-caked dark-blood-mud
Blood not oil had been on the cords

Smears were left where Todd had touched himself
_

This level was an abandoned hospital
All lay as if it had been unexpectedly sealed off

Dust caked everywhere 
Jordan could easily see their tracks back
They went forward in a cautious adventurous manner

Ben told them
'That shaft goes the length of the building
'This must be where they deposit all the bodies from the hospital
'But that expalaintion doesn't make much sense

Jordan continued
'It doesn't make much sense to have a hospital as a secret basement

At the end of the first hall Jordan looked into a room
On the bed was a familiar form

'Hold up

Jordan walked inside the room 
Only a bed pan & a flipped-over bed
With a swift fling he threw off the blanket

A long decayed corpse lay there turned off the fallen bed
The smell stung their noses sharply

The horror was simple
No screams or fear of life
Only a complete confidence that their life was in danger
_

A loud-clang, shuffle and meaty-wacks where heard 
A hoarse voice rose but was immedately silenced 

The boys took shelter in the room with the corpse for company
Its hair over-grown 
Its jaw dangled stoopidly

They waited long after the commotion stopped

Someone was trapped & beaten in the concealed sub-basement of the school
The authorities would no-doubt do likewise to the trio of boys

In an abandonded level, layers from escape, with only one known exit - an elevator shaft

Mousecraft was the sure way to go about these things
Patience & longwait'n until absolute vacancy was established

Jordan was the expert in this craft
For an entire period they waited 
The bells could still be faintly-heard

The silence was a time of meditation

Accept the drastic turn of this Friday morn
Be ready to decide upon actions with dire-consequences
_

Their eyes & senses now accustomed they proceeded

The halls were built in the same structure of their school
One large hall circled the outside classrooms and inner classrooms

All told obvious signs that this area was not used

Jordan headed their search 
He tracked the dust to know how long since last passage

The inside of rooms was the highest-end in the vacancy-spectrum:
Untouched -> long-since -> this-month -> this-week -> today 
_

Jordan now was on a path that was taken daily

The other head of the path led to a stairwell
They followed the head towards a large-open-room

Workstations arrayed the entire space

A low-hang-light draped over each stone table 
Rusted rungs were embedded as obvious retraint ports

Under each table were various shelves for various instruments
Jordans heart fainted 

All the tools in all the stations down all the rows had-been-used-recently

The room had been used sometime this month for a massive operation

The only daily path led to a table far at the end
The only table with its light on
_

Strapped to the table by a broad-leather-belt was a nude-redheaded-girl
So bruised was her face it was impossible to see her freckles

Freckles covered her entire body
Freckled to the point that tho bloody, bruised & nude - all was only the second characteristic noticed

She had stich-patch-openings all over her torso
Patches appeared in similar fashion all over her body

Her shut-eyes sprang into maniacal-alertness as two large yellow-orbs
Three boys, not monsters, stood over her

Jordan was unable to free any strap
'How to we get these loose

Confused near exhasperated he repeated
'How the fk do I get these off

Jewels looked back at him 
She opened a mutilated-stump-of-a-tongue-in-a-wag

A small muffled voice came to fullness
'Finally sorry 
'I cant speak 
'Hardly-breathe when she lays like that

'Don't you move like that neanderthal
Infantile hands pushed its way out of a tangle of hair 
A creature emerged: a shrunken-head with two arms attached
_

The trio looked agast 
The girl was part monster

'Yes this is a shock I understand
The little head said in a small voice

Jewels cast her face-to-the-side-ashamed
Nude & openly disfigured took over her perdicament as most-painful

The little head made a-small-exhasperated-sound and shrunk under the deflated-skin 
A lump under skin along her chest bulged as it moved like a hamster from her shoulder to her throat

'I talked to you earlier by broadcast of her vocal cords like this
'Now for the task at hand we have got to get the hell-out-of-dodge

'The bands are one leather belt
'Hurry there is not a second to spare

'Above our head you can release it 
'Hurry hurry you rats

'Jewels cannot speak & I can't read her mind
'But I can sense what she is feeling
'She feels ashamed of me right now

The lump moved back into the shrunked torso it puppeted
'Jewels hates when I do that
'But we need to get moving

It took a small roll of paper out of a back and started to read
'Lets get moving

Jordan found the clasp to be odd-shaped which took some ingenuity before it was released
All with the help of the metal bar and 6 arms

Jordans shirt was the least dirty
Jewels wore it as a small dress

Missy had them make a measurement & a cut
Ben's shoes didn't fit her but his socks did

'We need to hurry the goons will be back soon
'If we are still subterranean when that happens 
'Each one of us will be strapped down

The shrunked form talked with its hands
The motion of arms excentuated what its voice was limited to express
 
Promptly they made exodus from that devilish laboratory 
The light had a cruel elderly tint of an aged desperation 
The rays seemed to follow them in a-haunting-fashion as-if-pointing-direction
_

The elevator-cord was clean enough to allow them all quick access back up to the basement
Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their perdicament

Todd was smeared over in blood
Jordan was shirtless
All were caked in dust
& Then there was Jewels

Ben admitted
'How the fk are we going to get out of school

'I have a plan
Todd opened the closet door and walked into the school hall
