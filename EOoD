Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers that lined empty-halls

15 Minutes past the Bell
That point-of-no-return to class

Any student this late would get writ-up
Ironically worse than not arriving at all 

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail

His purpose was in the basement
To the door he planned to open

Latency becomes mounted by endless-anticipation
That energy from day-dreaming now as a hurdle
Aun compelled him towards the opposite direction

The thump of Todd's feet steady 
Step after step up stairs to higher floors

It was a peace appreciated in a place only-ever bustling-loudly
The few rays of the sun bore thru only to show the amount of dust in the air
_

The mellow ambience shattered as patters of run'n feet charged towards his direction from around the corner
Fortune had placed Todd directly opposite of the girls restroom

The distance was leapt in one bound and he rushed to the last stall
He let out a cocky smirk of the ingenuity of hiding in the girls

!! KAK 

The cracked-seat broke plunging his left-foot ankle-deep into hour-old piss & shit
He caught his balance with his arms to save the other foot

The door quietly opened
Someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled yell came from the hallway 
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

!! BOOM 
Heavy legs near-cracked-the-door-in-half 

That unexpected fright broke unprecedented-pressure into full-release

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSPPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP

The entire school vibrated with the overwhelming sound of a prolonged-volcano-blast 

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN YOU SHOULDA SAID WHY YOU NEEDED THE GIRLS 
One of the schoolhall-monitors hooted out for-the-entire-building-to-know 

The last of this announcement was gagged-quiet as gas particles bloomed-out in a thick cloud
_

The room was silent after the door fell shut and resettled
The building now seemed to rumble in a giggle 

!! PAT 
!! PAT 
!! PAT 

'Gonna make your fat-cunt-ass eat that shit you scabby bitch
Ben kicked at the stall door braced-shut by legs

'Back off
Todd stepped out of the stall

Ben turned to him even more crazed

!YOU   

'You are the reason I got chased

Todd was tackled to the wall 
Slaming hard as his wet foot slipped out

'walk'n around
'like you weren't skipping class
Ben muffled as he struggled out his revenge

'a teacher notified 
'the monitors and got me chased down 
Ben righteously continued

Todd manuevered around using Ben's force against him
Then with his forarms placed Ben in a locked-hold 

After several curses and a long pause Ben surrendered
'Alright asshole you made your point

Todd pushed Ben off to a safe distance
A toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that
Jordan blushed-out the awkward introduction
'Im sick

Today would haunt Ben's reputation a long time
For a while they were content with breathing the gas in silence 
_

Walls washed white layer-after-layer
Exentuated by the dark recesses between the tiles
Unable to conceal the deep-red of the grafitti symbols
That were easily visible when seen as a whole

Piss marked all to a feminine territory 
If only the stain but mostly the smell

Curiosity only met horrors 

Ben broke the silence 
'This place is kinda creepy
All of them had been repelled from investigations

High-hot-boxed in a room full of fumes
No where to go until the class period ended

A sound tickled Todd's ear
He moved closer to the wall

Todd was startled then reaffirmed
'There is a hum that sounds like a whimper
'Can you guys hear it

Jordan put in as he neared 
'Probably a ghost
'This school is hella haunted
He yelled at the trash-can playfully

Todd motioned them to the second-vent 
Next to the garbage-can

The rust smeared as Todd opened the lid for better acoustics
'It comes from this trash-vent

Suddenly Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

( need help help please help )

The sound came softened from great distance
But with a fullness-of-scream that rips apart throat-lining

The communication so faint Todd looked to the others for confirmation

( help us    please )

Jordan ventured  
'Here      
'we are here
'Where are you

( can you hear me  hello please help )

Jordan continued 
'We hear you
'We will get the Principal

( noooooooooooo ! )

The shriek took all three back in a tight terror

( they did this to her! )

Todd opened the lid with both his hands to shout down
'Who ever you are
'Where ever you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately, the others followed dazed 
To them it seemed a reckless promise

At 10-min-to-the-bell the hall is at its most empty
Policy prohibits anyone out-in-the-hall 

The trio made their way without obstruction 
The Monitors would be back in their lounge on the couch

'I discovered this door when I got lost my first-year fire-drill
'All year I been trying to work myself up to this before graduation 

Todd was the only-one-he-knew that had seen that long-corridor
Despite years he still believed in what he had seen

'I spent the past 2 years dreaming about exploring it
'Today is too much of a coincidence
'That door will lead us to her

They followed the stairwells down
Crossed lengths of halls of the first year students

Todd continued
'When I got lost 

'I felt someone calling out to me by-name 
'I followed tho less-than-a-handful knew my name

'I found a door at the end of the hall 
'It was unlocked
'I first peaked in only out of curiosity 

'At the back of the closet there was a lightsource instead of shadow
'I went in to see a long corridor
'The path went on for a long time 
'It ended at a black hole in a wall

'I am sure it leads down 
'But I forced myself to go back before I got near enough to know

Todd looked ahead determined
The pent-up-forces now-unleashed propelled him forward

Jordan stirred with the brisk walk expounded
'I did research on this school for all my papers
'This floor is suposed to be the basement

'Right so with that-in-mind
'There was one article of a peculiar-incident

'A boy was found brutally-seperated in a satanic-ritual
'The article said the incident was found out by the janitor
'The Recession took his home & he slept at school 

'The article mentions the location as the 3rd-Basement floor 
'That could be considered a typo caz there is only one basement

'But at the time there were only two levels
'University Hospital was built on top of the school 
'An entire decade later

Ben countered at the steamrolling logic
'I been here all 3 years of school

'If there was a sub basement there would be some proof
'A reworked stairwell that meets up with the other stairwells
'There would be left structural pillars

Ben's logic was solid but life seldom follows logic
'You both believe that a stairwell could just disappear
_

The exterior wall in the corner of the basement held a closet door
Todd's sweaty palms slid on the locked knob

A narrow closet was exposed by the small window

'Let me get this
Jordan knelt in front, took off his pack, and retrieved a pouch

The door was open and pack back on Jordan's back before the other two could follow the action 

Once inside the back after the brooms & mops
A corridor was revealed to turn down a very-long-hallway

The narrow corridor followed the exterior wall

They followed in the errie-way of knowing an action would change their life forever

Ben said as endorphins flowed into his brain in bounty of an oft asked question
'I always thought it was odd there were no small windows in any of the rooms on this floor
'So this is the real outer wall

The wall made of pilgrim-old-brick, large & thick
The bricks a dark-purple, like the color of space
_

The tunnel was bare and held no purpose
No back doors to any classrooms
It only continued long-passage-after-long-passage

The end came up as a blank wall

Ben chirp'd
'The architect must have been a comedian

Jordan countered
'Or a way to hide access to an entire level in a closet
'This bay was too huge to tame for early history

'Pirates frequently raided here
'Often they kidnapped children

Ben noticed on the old bricks
Symbols carved in peculiar diagrams 
The spraw of it was typical of angry graffiti

They came to the end
It was abrput as Todd had stated
But it had no hole nor door

Todd's nails scraped against the wall until he found an edge

Jordan moved him out of the way 
He went to work with a thin steel bar

The peeled-paint revealed a metal door 
2ft above-the-ground 3ft high-and-wide

Todd took the bar from Jordan & pryed open the hinges into a creaked submission
Somehow Todd always knew this went down & now he saw into the black depths

The door had the lock from the inside of this shaft
Smart for the pilgrims
_

Dark musty air flowed immedately to them strong-as-a-gulf-breeze
Something caught Todds eye
He poked at it with the bar

Elevator-cords hung in the mid hidden by darkness
'If there are 3 lower basements 
'Then there are two floors to explore

An exchange of glances agreed compliance

Jordan looked casual 
Ben looked like he would not back down

Todd reached with extended-arm and grasped the cord
In a hard pull he let himself be drawn into the darkness

Unexpectedly Todds hands began to slide 
He rapidly descended scream'n

!!OHSHIT
_

All was dark 
Distance only an abstract measurment

Movement was only testified by the-burning-of-his-palms
Sweat-sprung as his will-fought-for-his-life

Todd ventured his legs out 
He managed to stop himself into near splits

!!! TODD

The other two screamed frantically down

Todd looked up 
The door only a small sliver of light

'Im okay
'Im okay

'There is oil on the cords
'I should have expected it
'Gonna take off my shirt and use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

Ben asked automatically without idea on how to back up the offer
'Do you need help up

Todd fearless began to climb at a controlled rate
'Its best only one person be on the cord at the same time
'Im gonna try to find a door to get to the lower floors
_

Todd didn't notice any doors in the commotion down

The best course would be to climb up slowly to ensure he could get back up
He would feel for an open'n with this feet

The slide down had cleared off most of the oil
His hands now had clean purchase

The only sound was his breath and the swell of air
The gusts came intesnse rising with the heat-from-deep-darkness

Todd felt a gust on his stomach
It was cool & didn't come from below
He stomped out the outline of the door

! TWANG
! TWANG

A sliver beam bore into the darkness

'I think
'I think I found it

With one hand he felt for a handle
The door was there, he could feel the cold metal

!! POMP 
!! POMP 

Todd stomped the corner down 
He pulled himself higher kick'n down until the door gave way
He pulled himeself into the dusty grey hallway

'Im off the cords 
'Come down

'Wrap your shirt around your hands
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Ben & Jordan followed down and swiftly entered

Ben climbed inside scraping his knee
Looking up saw Todd and shrieked back falling-on-his-ass

! FUCK

Todd was covered in dusk-caked dark-blood-mud
Blood not oil had been on the cords

Smears were left where Todd had touched himself
_

This level was an abandoned hospital
All lay as if it had been unexpectedly sealed off

Dust caked everywhere 
Jordan could easily see their tracks back
They went forward in a cautious adventurous manner

Ben told them
'That shaft goes the length of the building
'This must be where they deposit all the bodies from the hospital
'But that expalaintion doesn't make much sense

Jordan continued
'It doesn't make much sense to have a hospital as a secret basement

At the end of the first hall Jordan looked into a room
On the bed was a familiar form

'Hold up

Jordan walked inside the room 
Only a bed pan & a flipped-over bed
With a swift fling he threw off the blanket

A long decayed corpse lay there turned off the fallen bed
The smell stung their noses sharply

The horror was simple
No screams or fear of life
Only a complete confidence that their life was in danger
_

A loud-clang, shuffle and meaty-wacks where heard 
A hoarse voice rose but was immedately silenced 

The boys took shelter in the room with the corpse for company
Its hair over-grown 
Its jaw dangled stoopidly

They waited long after the commotion stopped

Someone was trapped & beaten in the concealed sub-basement of the school
The authorities would no-doubt do likewise to the trio of boys

In an abandonded level, layers from escape, with only one known exit - an elevator shaft

Mousecraft was the sure way to go about these things
Patience & longwait'n until absolute vacancy was established

Jordan was the expert in this craft
For an entire period they waited 
The bells could still be faintly-heard

The silence was a time of meditation

Accept the drastic turn of this Friday morn
Be ready to decide upon actions with dire-consequences
_

Their eyes & senses now accustomed they proceeded

The halls were built in the same structure of their school
One large hall circled the outside classrooms and inner classrooms

All told obvious signs that this area was not used

Jordan headed their search 
He tracked the dust to know how long since last passage

The inside of rooms was the highest-end in the vacancy-spectrum:
Untouched -> long-since -> this-month -> this-week -> today 
_

Jordan now was on a path that was taken daily

The other head of the path led to a stairwell
They followed the head towards a large-open-room

Workstations arrayed the entire space

A low-hang-light draped over each stone table 
Rusted rungs were embedded as obvious retraint ports

Under each table were various shelves for various instruments
Jordans heart fainted 

All the tools in all the stations down all the rows had-been-used-recently

The room had been used sometime this month for a massive operation

The only daily path led to a table far at the end
The only table with its light on
_

Strapped to the table by a broad-leather-belt was a nude-redheaded-girl
So bruised was her face it was impossible to see her freckles

Freckles covered her entire body
Freckled to the point that tho bloody, bruised & nude - all was only the second characteristic noticed

She had stich-patch-openings all over her torso
Patches appeared in similar fashion all over her body

Her shut-eyes sprang into maniacal-alertness as two large yellow-orbs
Three boys, not monsters, stood over her

Jordan was unable to free any strap
'How to we get these loose

Confused near exhasperated he repeated
'How the fk do I get these off

Jewels looked back at him 
She opened a mutilated-stump-of-a-tongue-in-a-wag

A small muffled voice came to fullness
'Finally sorry 
'I cant speak 
'Hardly-breathe when she lays like that

'Don't you move like that neanderthal
Infantile hands pushed its way out of a tangle of hair 
A creature emerged: a shrunken-head with two arms attached
_

The trio looked agast 
The girl was part monster

'Yes this is a shock I understand
The little head said in a small voice

Jewels cast her face-to-the-side-ashamed
Nude & openly disfigured took over her perdicament as most-painful

The little head made a-small-exhasperated-sound and shrunk under the deflated-skin 
A lump under skin along her chest bulged as it moved like a hamster from her shoulder to her throat

'I talked to you earlier by broadcast of her vocal cords like this
'Now for the task at hand we have got to get the hell-out-of-dodge

'The bands are one leather belt
'Hurry there is not a second to spare

'Above our head you can release it 
'Hurry hurry you rats

'Jewels cannot speak & I can't read her mind
'But I can sense what she is feeling
'She feels ashamed of me right now

The lump moved back into the shrunked torso it puppeted
'Jewels hates when I do that
'But we need to get moving

It took a small roll of paper out of a back and started to read
'Lets get moving

Jordan found the clasp to be odd-shaped which took some ingenuity before it was released
All with the help of the metal bar and 6 arms

Jordans shirt was the least dirty
Jewels wore it as a small dress

Missy had them make a measurement & a cut
Ben's shoes didn't fit her but his socks did

'We need to hurry the goons will be back soon
'If we are still subterranean when that happens 
'Each one of us will be strapped down

The shrunked form talked with its hands
The motion of arms excentuated what its voice was limited to express
 
Promptly they made exodus from that devilish laboratory 
The light had a cruel elderly tint of an aged desperation 
The rays seemed to follow them in a-haunting-fashion as-if-pointing-direction
_

The elevator-cord was clean enough to allow them all quick access back up to the basement
Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their perdicament

Todd was smeared over in blood
Jordan was shirtless
All were caked in dust
& Then there was Jewels

Ben admitted
'How the fk are we going to get out of school

'I have a plan
Todd opened the closet door and walked into the school hall

Dusty 
Shirtless 
Pantless 
Bloody

They broke into the hall cast from horror  

Sharply outlined to a monotony of normal scenes 
The view more contrast by their outlandish forms 

Todd had a plan in his mind 
A preplanned route of exit

They made it to the end of the hall in the basement before a teacher stopped her lecture 
She opened the door and yelled

!!! MONITOR
!!! MONITOR SECTION 7

The call for all students to plaster at the hall-windows
The four spectacted only by classmates 
They turned the corner to rush up the stairwell

The teachers in this way were barred from looking out
Two large Monitors stood as sentinels in locked-down-protocol at the-main-exit

!!! MONITORS SECTION 1

Two voices boomed

But Todd already turn lead'n them up stairwells across the level in-a-juke 

There was no time to explain 
Only for Todd to choose and the rest to follow

Cross the school in this method all Monitors would be drawn to the wrong location
Higher up the school levels not at ground floor as expected
_

Every window was filled 
Every door was blocked 

Curious children stirred by shouts
Starving to get sight of the spectation after an eventful-day

This the factor that allowed the 5 to get to the second-floor unhindered
They passed the restroom of the morn towards the end of the hall

'Just do what I do and go where I go
He took out a key from his pocket & unlocked the window

They climbed onto a narrow ledge outside
The sun shone hotly on them 
They burned under it with exhaustion

The world around them too-busy-with-the-day to notice four-odd-bodies outside on the second-story

The ledge continued to an adjacent roof 
They crossed over to a high-branched tree

The branch overhung onto the roof in an entangled attachment

By that means they climbed downn to the lower level at the back of the school
Onward into alleys that led them to the less traveled roads

Each of the boys knew how to pass-this-area without-being-seen
They ran tired but they now knew this stage was their turf

They new which fences led where
Up which buildings to go where

Rats true now they could not get caught

Jewels only had a large shirt & Ben's sweaty socks

The large city bustlers continued their way without heed 
The four moved in a pack following Jordan's lead
_

They arrived at the edge of the Downtown 
The outskirts of the industrial sector 

Jordan turned them into an alley 
& Thru a chain-linked-fence he loosed as an opening 

Thru a locked window they quickly entered
The edifice was as dusty as the sub-basement

They cautiously followed Jordan's movements 
Hopping from board to board
Their trace without tracks up the stairs to a room

Jordan locked the room with a chain after they entered 
He then pushed away a cabinet to reveal another chain-locked door

'This far from anyone 
'I like to be triple sure that I am secure

An outside window exposed the endless ocean
Dust free & ocean breeze 

Jordan led them thru the window to a ledge that was covered in tarps
The floor was of netted-metal 
A repurposed fire-escape

'I got a tank of rain water
Jordan motioned with his hands
'Open the spout & close it with this knob

He motioned them to turn around
'It aint clear-water but its better than nothing

He took a brisk wash in water heated by the sun
The water splashed far below 

Ben asked Jordan 
'So what is this place

Jordan looked down as his face blushed
'This is one of the places I go to live

They showered with Todd last as he was so bloody
_

Refreshed & completely exhausted 
All laid on layers of cardboard-stiched mats like japanese-tatami

Ocean gusts massaged their tense skin
All slept till the next morn in safe slumbers soothed by the-sound-of-steady-waves

Jordan fed them dried fruit & granola 
Desert was a Mtn-Dew

'I got locations like this all over the city
'Each of them has a stash of all I need

'But I was stuck across town this week 
'I ate bad food I stashed 

!fk

Ben realized his perdicament with this father
His father would be ready with a self-righteous beating 

It was Saturday morn
From Friday-morn to now seemed a trance
_

Jordan trailed their exit, covering their tracks as they returned to the streets
'Take everything 
'I never go to the same place in the same week

Ben needed to get to the payphone at the lower-district-Circle-K
The day was warming to a hot day
The heat relaxed their overworked muscles after the stiff sleep

Ben looked at Todd
'We only have enough for one call
'You mind if I use it

Todd complied
'I am the last of the litter 
'My room is at the very end of the hallway
'My parents wouldn't know if I was gone for a week

Jordan had a rummage of clothes at that place
Raided from the downtown charity 

Jewels was head-to-toe with garments that mostly fit
She had sandals with wool stockings
The light-blue summer-dress only a little too-short 

Jordan now wore a pocketed vest
Ben took an old-leather-jacket
Todd took a set of wool gloves for his hands

The shrunken head had stayed silent since their escape 
It held a little well-wade umbrella acting unoffended

The pressing pace of life left Jewels to be sorted out
_

After 4 rings 
Ben tried the oldman's next-door

This wasn't the first time
This exact thing has happened

The old voice responded
'Heeh Hello

'Mr. Grinvix this is Ben 
There was no response for some time

'I just wanted to call to ask about my dad
'He isnt answer'n the phone
'If you see him can you tell him I got a way home

Ben waited awkwardly 
Only the sound of heavy breath'n

'Your dad
'is dead boy

'You best get to the authorities 
'an have 'em tell ya

The voice was sympathetic but immediately hung up 

Ben stood silent leaving the phone to his ear
Flabbergasted from a truth-revealed-lie
That his dad would always be there

A jackass who kept light of heart
To never-again hit him nor give him advice-no-other-could

Ben physically-worked to come-to-grips to understandings toppled down
Dazed among rubble

The four in slience left him there to wail
Him not wanting company 
_

!!! PLUUPP 
!!! PLUPPP 

A police car had silently snuck up behind the crew
Its lights now bright at their backs

'Alright you juuhhhh 
The cop cut short as the pack immediately bolted

He turned & fumbled open the door he had preemptively shut
Today was not the mood to be disrespected by children

'Broc here
'I got a 281 on that 48f
'Update the 48f is now a 49f 

He reversed with sirens blareing
He was confident he didn't need to look back 

His focus-as-predator at the kids
In that action he was fused into the corner-store 

An overworked-trucker plowed him to death
Flesh crunched in sharp folds of metal
Dorito-chips & Drown'n in Slurpee
_

Todd looked back in relief 
That cop coming must have been the result of Ben calling his neighbor

What was this all about?
Did it have to do with Ben?
Or is this a result of yesterday?

======================================================================

======================================================================

Todd led the exhausted group 
Up the hills towards his home 

Ben had not said a word
This group kept silence naturally

If this was about Ben it would be known 
Or if this is about yesterday it would be known
 
His own life would likewise be shattered
That horizon closer with each step & familiar-landmark

A synchronized group says less & does more

Complaining only weighs others down
& In the midst of a journey enough is enough 

Silence lightens the load with comtemplation
Silent interactions the substance of their communication 

The deep sleep of last night swept away traceless 

Now only the entreched feeling of a labor with no timely solution
Now only the acceptance of pain as a-state-of-being

The five miles drew two hours time
Under sun over cloudless sky
_

Seagulls squaked at them 
Enjoy'n the uncomfortable position
Of beings the gulls envied

Tables had turned to the birds favor
What is toilsome for humans is a lesiure birds

The world continued careless inside cars disconnected from their temporary coordinates
Distracted by the thought of the destination 

Four souls suffering & unable to begin to voice the matters-at-hand
Their souls at full-capacity with the present journey
_

'My name is Miss
Miss broke the silence 

The communication took time to digest
After the miles & silence of misery

Miss paitently continued
'I have been attached by operation  
'To this girl Jewels who was offered
'As sacrifice to the diety Dagon

'Dagon is a cosmic god
'Earth is bribed to him
'As an occult offer'n

'An exchange for the bounty
'To which the god bestows
'After the feast of a meal

'All Earth he will swallow
'To drain dry as Mars

'Great powers lie in the foundations of this cult
'The blessings of omnipotent-powers-uncalculable 

'Some envision the gift of infinite-life
'Indesuptably to be as god themself

'I am one of those in faith of Dagon
'All worth in exchange for a god's blessing

'Jewels was the daughter of a wealthy family
'To pay the price of a family to join 
'The prime of their seed must be exchanged

'I am 400 years old
'The symbiotic member of this girl

'As payment into the order 
'The past must live as youth

'Don't be fooled I offer much

'I heal her & repair her
'Myself surgeon centries-in-experience
'I guarntee her life till old age as a promise

The mass of Miss moved in a manmade-skull the size-of-a-small-ball 
The ball free to move to diffferent parts of Jewels body with stations

The right shoulder is her perch 
She talks there with the arms 

'We worship the bowels of Dagon
'In Jewels is inserted divine microbials
'This the digestion of the gods

'When I was an old woman we found the asteroid
'Tales of Eastern-Monks tourtured guided us to that mountain-village

'Decades of mining to the asteroid
'Prophesised trajectory since 10,000 years to arrive
'Legend ever-present at the earliest historical escavations

'The asteroid contained maverelous gifts 
'The exrecement of Dagon passed us advantages ages ahead
'Sadly only this small mass of what you see was left
'When the bateria-microbials were adjusted to our needs 

'These microbrial bacteria enhance Jewels completly 
'Bacteria that worship the well-being of the host as life-itself

'Jewels is stronger than all of you combined
'No more need for blood 
'Microbials refine all to ingestion at all parts

'I myself was the first generation to live with prepared hosts
'Viceroy Countess Miss of the Prime Circle - priestess of the many

'All work for the betterment of the whole 
'Which is Jewels

'I would proclaim she owes us much 
'But she is a foolish girl gets youthful emotions 

'Yes Jewels is foolish
'Myself always busy patch'n up what she self inflicts

'Tho I am sympathtic to her need 
'To be kept from our modular fashion

'The inner courts ordered her to be pieced
'Into a more streamlined-being

'The operation was for this morn 

'Jewels is held by us as a priestess
'Name annointed Jewels by the Seer who fated her to rise above the most high

'The freckles that she holds on her body are themself maps to constellations
'The coordinates of a universe that attracts the best quantum-possibilites of all situations

'The Seer will seek her out because she is this map 
'This will leads us to that universe 
'After the boon of Dagon when this world is consumed 

'The freckles ever-changing as echoes to the quantum world
'Understand this - her future has such consequence
'Fate has mapped upon her a constellations of a specific-destination

'Only by Dagon is this map useful 
'Only by the bount will we be able to reach that far-away location

'Miss has been entrusted
'Myself her humble lord

Miss stayed herself a while for Jewels to regain strength
It was not easy for Miss to talk while Jewels walked 

'The Esoteric Order of Dagon dates to mankinds earliest history 

'Trends have taken its symbolism to idolitary 
'Fools will be fools

'The image of the lord Dagon is alone necessary to wield unobstructed power 
'Molecules themself bow to will in presence of that image

'I myself am a prophetess ordained by the Seer
'The Seer secretly entitled me to follow paths as Jewels wished

'But even the force of the whole-cult was too much to stop

'The thunder of your friend woke us 
'Providence appeared you before us 
'To show us out of an unbreachable-system 

'Knights & heroes pale to the deeds 
'Which you have yesterday all fulfilled

Miss was odd company to have 
The only thing pleasant on the long stretch to Todd's house
