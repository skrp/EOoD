Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers that lined empty-halls

15 Minutes past the Bell
That point-of-no-return to class

Any student this late would get writ-up
Ironically worse than not arriving at all 

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail

His purpose was in the basement
To the door he planned to open

Latency becomes mounted by endless-anticipation
That energy from day-dreaming now as a hurdle
Aun compelled him towards the opposite direction

The thump of Todd's feet steady 
Step after step up stairs to higher floors

It was a peace appreciated in a place only-ever bustling-loudly
The few rays of the sun bore thru only to show the amount of dust in the air
_

The mellow ambience shattered as patters of run'n feet charged towards his direction from around the corner
Fortune had placed Todd directly opposite of the girls restroom

The distance was leapt in one bound and he rushed to the last stall
He let out a cocky smirk of the ingenuity of hiding in the girls

!! KAK 

The cracked-seat broke plunging his left-foot ankle-deep into hour-old piss & shit
He caught his balance with his arms to save the other foot

The door quietly opened
Someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled yell came from the hallway 
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

!! BOOM 
Heavy legs near-cracked-the-door-in-half 

That unexpected fright broke unprecedented-pressure into full-release

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSPPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP

The entire school vibrated with the overwhelming sound of a prolonged-volcano-blast 

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN YOU SHOULDA SAID WHY YOU NEEDED THE GIRLS 
One of the schoolhall-monitors hooted out for-the-entire-building-to-know 

The last of this announcement was gagged-quiet as gas particles bloomed-out in a thick cloud
_

The room was silent after the door fell shut and resettled
The building now seemed to rumble in a giggle 

!! PAT 
!! PAT 
!! PAT 

'Gonna make your fat-cunt-ass eat that shit you scabby bitch
Ben kicked at the stall door braced-shut by legs

'Back off
Todd stepped out of the stall

Ben turned to him even more crazed

!YOU   

'You are the reason I got chased

Todd was tackled to the wall 
Slaming hard as his wet foot slipped out

'walk'n around
'like you weren't skipping class
Ben muffled as he struggled out his revenge

'a teacher notified 
'the monitors and got me chased down 
Ben righteously continued

Todd manuevered around using Ben's force against him
Then with his forarms placed Ben in a locked-hold 

After several curses and a long pause Ben surrendered
'Alright asshole you made your point

Todd pushed Ben off to a safe distance
A toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that
Jordan blushed-out the awkward introduction
'Im sick

Today would haunt Ben's reputation a long time
For a while they were content with breathing the gas in silence 
_

Walls washed white layer-after-layer
Exentuated by the dark recesses between the tiles
Unable to conceal the deep-red of the grafitti symbols
That were easily visible when seen as a whole

Piss marked all to a feminine territory 
If only the stain but mostly the smell

Curiosity only met horrors 

Ben broke the silence 
'This place is kinda creepy
All of them had been repelled from investigations

High-hot-boxed in a room full of fumes
No where to go until the class period ended

A sound tickled Todd's ear
He moved closer to the wall

Todd was startled then reaffirmed
'There is a hum that sounds like a whimper
'Can you guys hear it

Jordan put in as he neared 
'Probably a ghost
'This school is hella haunted
He yelled at the trash-can playfully

Todd motioned them to the second-vent 
Next to the garbage-can

The rust smeared as Todd opened the lid for better acoustics
'It comes from this trash-vent

Suddenly Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

( need help help please help )

The sound came softened from great distance
But with a fullness-of-scream that rips apart throat-lining

The communication so faint Todd looked to the others for confirmation

( help us    please )

Jordan ventured  
'Here      
'we are here
'Where are you

( can you hear me  hello please help )

Jordan continued 
'We hear you
'We will get the Principal

( noooooooooooo ! )

The shriek took all three back in a tight terror

( they did this to her! )

Todd opened the lid with both his hands to shout down
'Who ever you are
'Where ever you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately, the others followed dazed 
To them it seemed a reckless promise

At 10-min-to-the-bell the hall is at its most empty
Policy prohibits anyone out-in-the-hall 

The trio made their way without obstruction 
The Monitors would be back in their lounge on the couch

'I discovered this door when I got lost my first-year fire-drill
'All year I been trying to work myself up to this before graduation 

Todd was the only-one-he-knew that had seen that long-corridor
Despite years he still believed in what he had seen

'I spent the past 2 years dreaming about exploring it
'Today is too much of a coincidence
'That door will lead us to her

They followed the stairwells down
Crossed lengths of halls of the first year students

Todd continued
'When I got lost 

'I felt someone calling out to me by-name 
'I followed tho less-than-a-handful knew my name

'I found a door at the end of the hall 
'It was unlocked
'I first peaked in only out of curiosity 

'At the back of the closet there was a lightsource instead of shadow
'I went in to see a long corridor
'The path went on for a long time 
'It ended at a black hole in a wall

'I am sure it leads down 
'But I forced myself to go back before I got near enough to know

Todd looked ahead determined
The pent-up-forces now-unleashed propelled him forward

Jordan stirred with the brisk walk expounded
'I did research on this school for all my papers
'This floor is suposed to be the basement

'Right so with that-in-mind
'There was one article of a peculiar-incident

'A boy was found brutally-seperated in a satanic-ritual
'The article said the incident was found out by the janitor
'The Recession took his home & he slept at school 

'The article mentions the location as the 3rd-Basement floor 
'That could be considered a typo caz there is only one basement

'But at the time there were only two levels
'University Hospital was built on top of the school 
'An entire decade later

Ben countered at the steamrolling logic
'I been here all 3 years of school

'If there was a sub basement there would be some proof
'A reworked stairwell that meets up with the other stairwells
'There would be left structural pillars

Ben's logic was solid but life seldom follows logic
'You both believe that a stairwell could just disappear
_

The exterior wall in the corner of the basement held a closet door
Todd's sweaty palms slid on the locked knob

A narrow closet was exposed by the small window

'Let me get this
Jordan knelt in front, took off his pack, and retrieved a pouch

The door was open and pack back on Jordan's back before the other two could follow the action 

Once inside the back after the brooms & mops
A corridor was revealed to turn down a very-long-hallway

The narrow corridor followed the exterior wall

They followed in the errie-way of knowing an action would change their life forever

Ben said as endorphins flowed into his brain in bounty of an oft asked question
'I always thought it was odd there were no small windows in any of the rooms on this floor
'So this is the real outer wall

The wall made of pilgrim-old-brick, large & thick
The bricks a dark-purple, like the color of space
_

The tunnel was bare and held no purpose
No back doors to any classrooms
It only continued long-passage-after-long-passage

The end came up as a blank wall

Ben chirp'd
'The architect must have been a comedian

Jordan countered
'Or a way to hide access to an entire level in a closet
'This bay was too huge to tame for early history

'Pirates frequently raided here
'Often they kidnapped children

Ben noticed on the old bricks
Symbols carved in peculiar diagrams 
The spraw of it was typical of angry graffiti

They came to the end
It was abrput as Todd had stated
But it had no hole nor door

Todd's nails scraped against the wall until he found an edge

Jordan moved him out of the way 
He went to work with a thin steel bar

The peeled-paint revealed a metal door 
2ft above-the-ground 3ft high-and-wide

Todd took the bar from Jordan & pryed open the hinges into a creaked submission
Somehow Todd always knew this went down & now he saw into the black depths

The door had the lock from the inside of this shaft
Smart for the pilgrims
_

Dark musty air flowed immedately to them strong-as-a-gulf-breeze
Something caught Todds eye
He poked at it with the bar

Elevator-cords hung in the mid hidden by darkness
'If there are 3 lower basements 
'Then there are two floors to explore

An exchange of glances agreed compliance

Jordan looked casual 
Ben looked like he would not back down

Todd reached with extended-arm and grasped the cord
In a hard pull he let himself be drawn into the darkness

Unexpectedly Todds hands began to slide 
He rapidly descended scream'n

!!OHSHIT
_

All was dark 
Distance only an abstract measurment

Movement was only testified by the-burning-of-his-palms
Sweat-sprung as his will-fought-for-his-life

Todd ventured his legs out 
He managed to stop himself into near splits

!!! TODD

The other two screamed frantically down

Todd looked up 
The door only a small sliver of light

'Im okay
'Im okay

'There is oil on the cords
'I should have expected it
'Gonna take off my shirt and use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

Ben asked automatically without idea on how to back up the offer
'Do you need help up

Todd fearless began to climb at a controlled rate
'Its best only one person be on the cord at the same time
'Im gonna try to find a door to get to the lower floors
_

Todd didn't notice any doors in the commotion down

The best course would be to climb up slowly to ensure he could get back up
He would feel for an open'n with this feet

The slide down had cleared off most of the oil
His hands now had clean purchase

The only sound was his breath and the swell of air
The gusts came intesnse rising with the heat-from-deep-darkness

Todd felt a gust on his stomach
It was cool & didn't come from below
He stomped out the outline of the door

! TWANG
! TWANG

A sliver beam bore into the darkness

'I think
'I think I found it

With one hand he felt for a handle
The door was there, he could feel the cold metal

!! POMP 
!! POMP 

Todd stomped the corner down 
He pulled himself higher kick'n down until the door gave way
He pulled himeself into the dusty grey hallway

'Im off the cords 
'Come down

'Wrap your shirt around your hands
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Ben & Jordan followed down and swiftly entered

Ben climbed inside scraping his knee
Looking up saw Todd and shrieked back falling-on-his-ass

! FUCK

Todd was covered in dusk-caked dark-blood-mud
Blood not oil had been on the cords

Smears were left where Todd had touched himself
_

This level was an abandoned hospital
All lay as if it had been unexpectedly sealed off

Dust caked everywhere 
Jordan could easily see their tracks back
They went forward in a cautious adventurous manner

Ben told them
'That shaft goes the length of the building
'This must be where they deposit all the bodies from the hospital
'But that expalaintion doesn't make much sense

Jordan continued
'It doesn't make much sense to have a hospital as a secret basement

At the end of the first hall Jordan looked into a room
On the bed was a familiar form

'Hold up

Jordan walked inside the room 
Only a bed pan & a flipped-over bed
With a swift fling he threw off the blanket

A long decayed corpse lay there turned off the fallen bed
The smell stung their noses sharply

The horror was simple
No screams or fear of life
Only a complete confidence that their life was in danger
_

A loud-clang, shuffle and meaty-wacks where heard 
A hoarse voice rose but was immedately silenced 

The boys took shelter in the room with the corpse for company
Its hair over-grown 
Its jaw dangled stoopidly

They waited long after the commotion stopped

Someone was trapped & beaten in the concealed sub-basement of the school
The authorities would no-doubt do likewise to the trio of boys

In an abandonded level, layers from escape, with only one known exit - an elevator shaft

Mousecraft was the sure way to go about these things
Patience & longwait'n until absolute vacancy was established

Jordan was the expert in this craft
For an entire period they waited 
The bells could still be faintly-heard

The silence was a time of meditation

Accept the drastic turn of this Friday morn
Be ready to decide upon actions with dire-consequences
_

Their eyes & senses now accustomed they proceeded

The halls were built in the same structure of their school
One large hall circled the outside classrooms and inner classrooms

All told obvious signs that this area was not used

Jordan headed their search 
He tracked the dust to know how long since last passage

The inside of rooms was the highest-end in the vacancy-spectrum:
Untouched -> long-since -> this-month -> this-week -> today 
_

Jordan now was on a path that was taken daily

The other head of the path led to a stairwell
They followed the head towards a large-open-room

Workstations arrayed the entire space

A low-hang-light draped over each stone table 
Rusted rungs were embedded as obvious retraint ports

Under each table were various shelves for various instruments
Jordans heart fainted 

All the tools in all the stations down all the rows had-been-used-recently

The room had been used sometime this month for a massive operation

The only daily path led to a table far at the end
The only table with its light on
_

Strapped to the table by a broad-leather-belt was a nude-redheaded-girl
So bruised was her face it was impossible to see her freckles

Freckles covered her entire body
Freckled to the point that tho bloody, bruised & nude - all was only the second characteristic noticed

She had stich-patch-openings all over her torso
Patches appeared in similar fashion all over her body

Her shut-eyes sprang into maniacal-alertness as two large yellow-orbs
Three boys, not monsters, stood over her

Jordan was unable to free any strap
'How to we get these loose

Confused near exhasperated he repeated
'How the fk do I get these off

Jewels looked back at him 
She opened a mutilated-stump-of-a-tongue-in-a-wag

A small muffled voice came to fullness
'Finally sorry 
'I cant speak 
'Hardly-breathe when she lays like that

'Don't you move like that neanderthal
Infantile hands pushed its way out of a tangle of hair 
A creature emerged: a shrunken-head with two arms attached
_

The trio looked agast 
The girl was part monster

'Yes this is a shock I understand
The little head said in a small voice

Jewels cast her face-to-the-side-ashamed
Nude & openly disfigured took over her perdicament as most-painful

The little head made a-small-exhasperated-sound and shrunk under the deflated-skin 
A lump under skin along her chest bulged as it moved like a hamster from her shoulder to her throat

'I talked to you earlier by broadcast of her vocal cords like this
'Now for the task at hand we have got to get the hell-out-of-dodge

'The bands are one leather belt
'Hurry there is not a second to spare

'Above our head you can release it 
'Hurry hurry you rats

'Jewels cannot speak & I can't read her mind
'But I can sense what she is feeling
'She feels ashamed of me right now

The lump moved back into the shrunked torso it puppeted
'Jewels hates when I do that
'But we need to get moving

It took a small roll of paper out of a back and started to read
'Lets get moving

Jordan found the clasp to be odd-shaped which took some ingenuity before it was released
All with the help of the metal bar and 6 arms

Jordans shirt was the least dirty
Jewels wore it as a small dress

Missy had them make a measurement & a cut
Ben's shoes didn't fit her but his socks did

'We need to hurry the goons will be back soon
'If we are still subterranean when that happens 
'Each one of us will be strapped down

The shrunked form talked with its hands
The motion of arms excentuated what its voice was limited to express
 
Promptly they made exodus from that devilish laboratory 
The light had a cruel elderly tint of an aged desperation 
The rays seemed to follow them in a-haunting-fashion as-if-pointing-direction
_

The elevator-cord was clean enough to allow them all quick access back up to the basement
Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their perdicament

Todd was smeared over in blood
Jordan was shirtless
All were caked in dust
& Then there was Jewels

Ben admitted
'How the fk are we going to get out of school

'I have a plan
Todd opened the closet door and walked into the school hall

Dusty 
Shirtless 
Pantless 
Bloody

They broke into the hall cast from horror  

Sharply outlined to a monotony of normal scenes 
The view more contrast by their outlandish forms 

Todd had a plan in his mind 
A preplanned route of exit

They made it to the end of the hall in the basement before a teacher stopped her lecture 
She opened the door and yelled

!!! MONITOR
!!! MONITOR SECTION 7

The call for all students to plaster at the hall-windows
The four spectacted only by classmates 
They turned the corner to rush up the stairwell

The teachers in this way were barred from looking out
Two large Monitors stood as sentinels in locked-down-protocol at the-main-exit

!!! MONITORS SECTION 1

Two voices boomed

But Todd already turn lead'n them up stairwells across the level in-a-juke 

There was no time to explain 
Only for Todd to choose and the rest to follow

Cross the school in this method all Monitors would be drawn to the wrong location
Higher up the school levels not at ground floor as expected
_

Every window was filled 
Every door was blocked 

Curious children stirred by shouts
Starving to get sight of the spectation after an eventful-day

This the factor that allowed the 5 to get to the second-floor unhindered
They passed the restroom of the morn towards the end of the hall

'Just do what I do and go where I go
He took out a key from his pocket & unlocked the window

They climbed onto a narrow ledge outside
The sun shone hotly on them 
They burned under it with exhaustion

The world around them too-busy-with-the-day to notice four-odd-bodies outside on the second-story

The ledge continued to an adjacent roof 
They crossed over to a high-branched tree

The branch overhung onto the roof in an entangled attachment

By that means they climbed downn to the lower level at the back of the school
Onward into alleys that led them to the less traveled roads

Each of the boys knew how to pass-this-area without-being-seen
They ran tired but they now knew this stage was their turf

They new which fences led where
Up which buildings to go where

Rats true now they could not get caught

Jewels only had a large shirt & Ben's sweaty socks

The large city bustlers continued their way without heed 
The four moved in a pack following Jordan's lead
_

They arrived at the edge of the Downtown 
The outskirts of the industrial sector 

Jordan turned them into an alley 
& Thru a chain-linked-fence he loosed as an opening 

Thru a locked window they quickly entered
The edifice was as dusty as the sub-basement

They cautiously followed Jordan's movements 
Hopping from board to board
Their trace without tracks up the stairs to a room

Jordan locked the room with a chain after they entered 
He then pushed away a cabinet to reveal another chain-locked door

'This far from anyone 
'I like to be triple sure that I am secure

An outside window exposed the endless ocean
Dust free & ocean breeze 

Jordan led them thru the window to a ledge that was covered in tarps
The floor was of netted-metal 
A repurposed fire-escape

'I got a tank of rain water
Jordan motioned with his hands
'Open the spout & close it with this knob

He motioned them to turn around
'It aint clear-water but its better than nothing

He took a brisk wash in water heated by the sun
The water splashed far below 

Ben asked Jordan 
'So what is this place

Jordan looked down as his face blushed
'This is one of the places I go to live

They showered with Todd last as he was so bloody
_

Refreshed & completely exhausted 
All laid on layers of cardboard-stiched mats like japanese-tatami

Ocean gusts massaged their tense skin
All slept till the next morn in safe slumbers soothed by the-sound-of-steady-waves

Jordan fed them dried fruit & granola 
Desert was a Mtn-Dew

'I got locations like this all over the city
'Each of them has a stash of all I need

'But I was stuck across town this week 
'I ate bad food I stashed 

!fk

Ben realized his perdicament with this father
His father would be ready with a self-righteous beating 

It was Saturday morn
From Friday-morn to now seemed a trance
_

Jordan trailed their exit, covering their tracks as they returned to the streets
'Take everything 
'I never go to the same place in the same week

Ben needed to get to the payphone at the lower-district-Circle-K
The day was warming to a hot day
The heat relaxed their overworked muscles after the stiff sleep

Ben looked at Todd
'We only have enough for one call
'You mind if I use it

Todd complied
'I am the last of the litter 
'My room is at the very end of the hallway
'My parents wouldn't know if I was gone for a week

Jordan had a rummage of clothes at that place
Raided from the downtown charity 

Jewels was head-to-toe with garments that mostly fit
She had sandals with wool stockings
The light-blue summer-dress only a little too-short 

Jordan now wore a pocketed vest
Ben took an old-leather-jacket
Todd took a set of wool gloves for his hands

The shrunken head had stayed silent since their escape 
It held a little well-wade umbrella acting unoffended

The pressing pace of life left Jewels to be sorted out
_

After 4 rings 
Ben tried the oldman's next-door

This wasn't the first time
This exact thing has happened

The old voice responded
'Heeh Hello

'Mr. Grinvix this is Ben 
There was no response for some time

'I just wanted to call to ask about my dad
'He isnt answer'n the phone
'If you see him can you tell him I got a way home

Ben waited awkwardly 
Only the sound of heavy breath'n

'Your dad
'is dead boy

'You best get to the authorities 
'an have 'em tell ya

The voice was sympathetic but immediately hung up 

Ben stood silent leaving the phone to his ear
Flabbergasted from a truth-revealed-lie
That his dad would always be there

A jackass who kept light of heart
To never-again hit him nor give him advice-no-other-could

Ben physically-worked to come-to-grips to understandings toppled down
Dazed among rubble

The four in slience left him there to wail
Him not wanting company 
_

!!! PLUUPP 
!!! PLUPPP 

A police car had silently snuck up behind the crew
Its lights now bright at their backs

'Alright you juuhhhh 
The cop cut short as the pack immediately bolted

He turned & fumbled open the door he had preemptively shut
Today was not the mood to be disrespected by children

'Broc here
'I got a 281 on that 48f
'Update the 48f is now a 49f 

He reversed with sirens blareing
He was confident he didn't need to look back 

His focus-as-predator at the kids
In that action he was fused into the corner-store 

An overworked-trucker plowed him to death
Flesh crunched in sharp folds of metal
Dorito-chips & Drown'n in Slurpee
_

Todd looked back in relief 
That cop coming must have been the result of Ben calling his neighbor

What was this all about?
Did it have to do with Ben?
Or is this a result of yesterday?

======================================================================

======================================================================

Todd led the exhausted group 
Up the hills towards his home 

Ben had not said a word
This group kept silence naturally

If this was about Ben it would be known 
Or if this is about yesterday it would be known
 
His own life would likewise be shattered
That horizon closer with each step & familiar-landmark

A synchronized group says less & does more

Complaining only weighs others down
& In the midst of a journey enough is enough 

Silence lightens the load with comtemplation
Silent interactions the substance of their communication 

The deep sleep of last night swept away traceless 

Now only the entreched feeling of a labor with no timely solution
Now only the acceptance of pain as a-state-of-being

The five miles drew two hours time
Under sun over cloudless sky
_

Seagulls squaked at them 
Enjoy'n the uncomfortable position
Of beings the gulls envied

Tables had turned to the birds favor
What is toilsome for humans is a lesiure birds

The world continued careless inside cars disconnected from their temporary coordinates
Distracted by the thought of the destination 

Four souls suffering & unable to begin to voice the matters-at-hand
Their souls at full-capacity with the present journey
_

'My name is Miss
Miss broke the silence 

The communication took time to digest
After the miles & silence of misery

Miss paitently continued
'I have been attached by operation  
'To this girl Jewels who was offered
'As sacrifice to the diety Dagon

'Dagon is a cosmic god
'Earth is bribed to him
'As an occult offer'n

'An exchange for the bounty
'To which the god bestows
'After the feast of a meal

'All Earth he will swallow
'To drain dry as Mars

'Great powers lie in the foundations of this cult
'The blessings of omnipotent-powers-uncalculable 

'Some envision the gift of infinite-life
'Indesuptably to be as god themself

'I am one of those in faith of Dagon
'All worth in exchange for a god's blessing

'Jewels was the daughter of a wealthy family
'To pay the price of a family to join 
'The prime of their seed must be exchanged

'I am 400 years old
'The symbiotic member of this girl

'As payment into the order 
'The past must live as youth

'Don't be fooled I offer much

'I heal her & repair her
'Myself surgeon centries-in-experience
'I guarntee her life till old age as a promise

The mass of Miss moved in a manmade-skull the size-of-a-small-ball 
The ball free to move to diffferent parts of Jewels body with stations

The right shoulder is her perch 
She talks there with the arms 

'We worship the bowels of Dagon
'In Jewels is inserted divine microbials
'This the digestion of the gods

'When I was an old woman we found the asteroid
'Tales of Eastern-Monks tourtured guided us to that mountain-village

'Decades of mining to the asteroid
'Prophesised trajectory since 10,000 years to arrive
'Legend ever-present at the earliest historical escavations

'The asteroid contained maverelous gifts 
'The exrecement of Dagon passed us advantages ages ahead
'Sadly only this small mass of what you see was left
'When the bateria-microbials were adjusted to our needs 

'These microbrial bacteria enhance Jewels completly 
'Bacteria that worship the well-being of the host as life-itself

'Jewels is stronger than all of you combined
'No more need for blood 
'Microbials refine all to ingestion at all parts

'I myself was the first generation to live with prepared hosts
'Viceroy Countess Miss of the Prime Circle - priestess of the many

'All work for the betterment of the whole 
'Which is Jewels

'I would proclaim she owes us much 
'But she is a foolish girl gets youthful emotions 

'Yes Jewels is foolish
'Myself always busy patch'n up what she self inflicts

'Tho I am sympathtic to her need 
'To be kept from our modular fashion

'The inner courts ordered her to be pieced
'Into a more streamlined-being

'The operation was for this morn 

'Jewels is held by us as a priestess
'Name annointed Jewels by the Seer who fated her to rise above the most high

'The freckles that she holds on her body are themself maps to constellations
'The coordinates of a universe that attracts the best quantum-possibilites of all situations

'The Seer will seek her out because she is this map 
'This will leads us to that universe 
'After the boon of Dagon when this world is consumed 

'The freckles ever-changing as echoes to the quantum world
'Understand this - her future has such consequence
'Fate has mapped upon her a constellations of a specific-destination

'Only by Dagon is this map useful 
'Only by the bount will we be able to reach that far-away location

'Miss has been entrusted
'Myself her humble lord

Miss stayed herself a while for Jewels to regain strength
It was not easy for Miss to talk while Jewels walked 

'The Esoteric Order of Dagon dates to mankinds earliest history 

'Trends have taken its symbolism to idolitary 
'Fools will be fools

'The image of the lord Dagon is alone necessary to wield unobstructed power 
'Molecules themself bow to will in presence of that image

'I myself am a prophetess ordained by the Seer
'The Seer secretly entitled me to follow paths as Jewels wished

'But even the force of the whole-cult was too much to stop

'The thunder of your friend woke us 
'Providence appeared you before us 
'To show us out of an unbreachable-system 

'Knights & heroes pale to the deeds 
'Which you have yesterday all fulfilled

Miss was odd company to have 
The only thing pleasant on the long stretch to Todd's house

The sun hot in the hour before noon

Lights were on at his house

The smell of the outside inside the house 
The windows were broken

Cats made out in all the shadows
Suddenly the felines sprang into a frenzy

A large Calaco immediately charged Todd 
Todd had two-smarts-on it with a kick & a snatch

Of the 10 cats that moved towards in the attack
None of them cared to risk in same fate of their leader

Calaco in a goolike-mash-upon-the-walls

The pulp of it arose a kitty's salivate'n hunger
Dispite quelled up with a great fear of the present
Several stopped for a taste

Cats swarmed over something on his parent's bed
Most of the body was chewed up but it was his mother

Vomiting into the habitual direction of the restroom
He there found his father in ass-out-face-plant hunched over the toilet

Todd cleared out his home
Macabre painted by stern-rigtheousness 

Each of the corpses foamed out of each mutilated orafice
Grey puss foamed as lines of each scratch

Past tears after the last of the cats caught in his grasps burst
Neighbors came out to witness only for a moment

Bathed in warm guts 
Todd would use his might to break them legs to legs above his head 
The belly would burst first

Cats in a lunacy to avoid the same fate
Mostly in actions that sealed their fate

The thick wool golves made for pussy-busting
_

Cats take too long to do anything 
Aun to their demise

10s of bodies litered the rooms 

Jules could not walk fast with the sandals
Jordan & Ben decided to give Todd his space

Near 100 disembowled bodies trailed Todd's direction

Over short distance the cat is quick
Over long distance mankind reigns supreme

Aun to naps the cats will be put off guard 
Only awoken too late
By the scent of gore dripping off Todd 

Over-fence, thru-yard, along-country-road, over-cemeteries, thru-fields
Until finally rocky bays of ocean 

Rock-to-rock in hops with crashing waves below
Cats moved with agility but Todd was much faster

The cats from boulder to boulder 
Death lay for mistake & for success

Only one entry into a thicket-walled-island
Todd climbed up birthed in gore 
_

The twist'n narrow tunnel opened up into a vast expanse 

Antiquated farm equipment
Animals of a rare variety

Fire-pits with altars countless coverd the open grounds
One solitary hut built large as a warehouse loomed in the center

Tatched roof to sustain hurricane winds
The edifice had a lifted concrete-foundation

A large bonfire pit in the center of the circular lot 
The cat with the first warning message only-just-returned
 
As if Todd introduced to be Reaper 
Slow is man to be slain barehanded

The three finally caught up to dunes
The cats would not near the area
All sat outside in a countless ring

Too tired from their massive trip
Too frightened to go move 

They had to be stepped over in an odd-caution 

Todd was off to himself 
All content to a corner 
_

Jewels stomached her way around the witch's hut
Parts of the witch were so-scattered-such she hoped it was the hungry cats 

Leatherbound Tomes laid upon altars under balcony 
Each with a center-pit
Great iron-pikes stood to hook a cauldron

Jewels spent her time in the study of these tomes
Or prolonged-deduction of the state of each pit

Symbols, parts & bowels
Mixtures & brews
_

The city was on lookout for them
There was no where to go but where they were

The supply of the witch enough to last years

Water piped from a resivoir the size of a pond 
It was kept lifted & clean

Firewood came pentiful off ocean drifts

Three weeks went by with even less words between them

All had lost much but Jordan & Jewels who kept to their own interests
They slept alone in front of the plentiful fire-pits
_

As if ordained with the methodology of ones soul
Jewels absorbed herself into learn'n the ways of the witch

Miss created a tome larger than four textboots in rectangle
A large wooden shield bound with iron each weather-resistant leather-pages

Leather-pages made from the thin flesh of the abundant dead cats
_

Jordan spent his time in exploration of the excellent situation of the island
This base would prove his most beloved 

Built from foundation to be off-the-grid
Preserve'n arguably better utilities than county

A worn rock cliff dropped off to deep ocean waters 
One leap would exfoliate ones skin in deep-cleanse

Sea life was plentiful
_

Ben & Todd in similar circumstance
Understood each other as entirely divergent with their reactions

There was a global power that aimed to get them at whatever cost

To have Ben's dad murdered in an unknown way
To send cat assassins crafted by wiccan conjury for the assasiantion of an entire household 

The price they had paid for their decisions were heavy
_

The song of every bay is 
Exiestence is only ever in seasons

Day after day today is only just another day

Todd & Ben both well-healed in time
In careful ways of slow-healing
_

Ben powered his laptop from the solar-powered station

Todd kept day-long meditations

Jordan lived in peace as if finally repaid back from turbid years 

Jewels shielded with a Tome she worshipped as shrine

Miss ever diligent to guide & grow her talents into abilities

Driscol had been closed permenantly
All students had transferred to different schools

They learned these facts back in town
A month had passed since it was closed

5 girls had gone missing after all the chaos
The lunch-lady said she saw two large men take a girl to the basement

There were no large men found in the basement
The lunch-lady is being held for questioning

The hospital also lost 25% of its patients
In an outbreak that left the city block full of wails

Police could only evacuate due to the madness
They spoke of monsters & fish-people
_

The lengthy trip to the city took half a day
Feline robbers allowed them a stash of funds

Which they now were able to spend freely
The store took another half of their day
_

Jewels & the cats kept to each other fondly
Cats avoided Todd at eyesight

Reveering Todd with gifts only as he slept
Dead rats, fish, live-crabs
_

The store was a feast 
They stuffed their packs with supplies 

Sacks of food were tied to their packs
twinkies bread peanut-butter cheeses

The Downtown bus was free for their age

All baytowns pull in lost loiters world wide
Each soul on drift with the tide drawn to far-away spheres

The library sat on the hill 
All the homeless hobos just below

The edifice kept an overgrown field to the back 
The lot left alone as a wild thicket

They had to crawl with their packs in front thru a maze 
The trail looked to be made by a rabbit

The walls were too narrow for an adult

Relentlessness if tried true broke a weary body into a open path
After insanity proved you to keep course

The thick vegitation on the open path only the netted-canopy-roof

Each of them bled

'I put those thorns in myself
Jordan said to their bewilderment

??? What

'Trust me I was much bloodier each day than you are now
'& That took me all winter & five jackets

'That added protection gaurantees security 

No one was in the mood to buy-into-that-reasoning
_

Dim sidewalk lights lit the completely enclosed concrete path 

Miss admired the only one cheery
'Heavy & resilient cords were attached by several posts for that darned Carnival
'If there weren't such death to the tale I'd call it a hoot-to-boot

'The lazy immigrant workers only-just set-up & drunk in celebration
'To the death of many they became caught with the Hurricane 

'From different lands is the different fish as they say
'The hurricane rearraged this area but these cords held strong 
'They are the foundation for this thick canopy

The path led to a utility shed 
Power & water & network
It was now a fortess of tickets

'The place forgotten the years that followed Huricane Karma
'The two years after Karma only Univeristy Hospital able to keep open 

'That is why the Tower off-the-grid-independence
'Able to be the host of the entire regions network

Ben jolted
'The entire region is networked to the same place
That is why all his tracers returned bogus DNS information

Jordan explained
'My grandpa used to work this lot
'It used to be only grass

'I discovered this after a school research project on our ancestors
'There were several pictures of my grampa at this place for Fairs

Jordan pointed to a framed map on the wall
'I found it in old schematics at the library 

They all took comfort in the utilities
There was a makeshift shower built for privacy

A hose & a drain
But welcome after their hard-days

All together center room missing the comfort of fire
They passed around the supplies Jordan had rationed
His picks at the grocery-store were mostly non-edible, except for the cheese

Jordan last to sit
'One day I was stuck on this side of town
'It was rain'n like a muthfkr & cold as hell

'The security guard saw me loitering & called me inside

'He told me I could stay until his shift ended at 6am
'I ate half of his lunch & dried-up

'I was so cold I drank the entire pot of coffee

'I would have used the sink to bathe
'But that would have freaked him out

Jordan looked to the others
In confirmation that the action was indeed weird

'I left in a very good mood & used pure force to make my way here
'First time I ever had coffee I couldn't stop the pursuit until I arrived

'The state of it is just as it is today 
'It was easier to get thru back-then
'But I have to brute-force some parts
'Hell quarter-mile far crawling

'I was expect'n to find the shed as only four posts 
'But as you can see it is largly left in good condition 
_

The four rested on bedding stuffed with old leaves
In the same japanese-tatami-fashion

Electricity filled their time 

Ben took a trip with Jules to return with the computer
This place a much more stable enviornment for electronics

Now knowing the region's network hub he would find ease exploring
Direct link in a network forging addresses

Carefree lives begged obsession

Ben used his unix network'n skills to secure them deals with locals
rides, chores, grocery
They got money doing homework nationwide
 
When they needed odd necessities Ben would find various people to do them
Ben had collected many names with reputation of which he manuevered to get what he needed

This deal consisted of transistors, pop-tars, Mtn-Dew
The guy offered to throw in an 1/8 of shrooms & marijuana
Ben who mistook them as being cook'n mushrooms, this thinking obvious from coming from the store
The well-tipped-driver planted the stash gratefuly in the paper bag

Jordan oathed them all to wait for an hour in the bush before entering
That was one of Jordans oathsworn protocols

Ben resistless obeyed so great was his appreciation
A tap into the regional network with always-on power

Ben had been grab'n data from the archives at the library 
He stored them onto drives he implanted in each computer

With the cat's money he built a mainframe easily 
It constantly whirred with its different activities
To greet him as he opened the shed door with the arms of supplies

'Who ordered the weed
Jordan immediately popped up surprised 

'Jewels will like these
Miss said overlook'n Jewels rummage'n thru the bag

Cats were everywhere except around Todd
The 5 pimped out the pussy getting new cats nightly

Here they would be fed & taught the ways
The decimated ranks grew & grew

OG cats kept to themselves
Knowing the truth of Todd
_

The boys kept down their communication naturally 
Miss left no way to communicate with Jewels independently

When Todd lurched out his hand force'n the ball that was Miss in one location
The other two acted without preemption 
At first Jewels was held down firm

Jordan went to grab the chain, they had to settle this
Todd struggled not to strangle Miss while fight'n down Jewels
Who the two could not break to submission
Any minor victory was responded with greater loss
'We
'we need to know

! CRUNCH 
Jewels head butt Tood's jaw closed

'ST STOP
Ben got at her but she let her elbow fly, accoustomed to more monsterous holds

Jules broke free and ran into the restroom
Ben was praying his nose wasn't broken 

He bled out like a fountain

It was time before Todd got the idea to pass thru a notebook

'Trust me when I say Miss is dear to me
'Her over anyone else is my true friend
_

Blood is thick with one's identity
The composition is stired by one's emotion

Blood magic draws stregth from those forces
They drank the brew of shroom blood masked with mint leaves

Worked together into a pactice of blood
To bind themselves together in rites

Trance-State-Jewels formed an intricate DIAGRAM in the center of the floor

'May the blood split
'For concern of other
'Bind us five together

Four of them as corners
Arms the connection between
Legs to stablise & aid momentum
Eyes to see the truth in individual

The vapor off the aroma they inhaled as icense
The hot brew in their stomachs digested

The pot laid in the circle 
Chalked-around-with their diagrams

Hours upons hours passed morn night morn
 
Their movements as all-surfing-on-the-same-wave
In-tune at different positions on the swell

All looked at the other in odd understand'n
As if whispers built bonds stronger with assurance

They kept their hands together bound
As Jewels would voicelessly passed them over the struggles discomfort

Miss recited

'Comfort is a worthy sacifice
'How do you care for that which is not worth the sacrifice

'We care for each other
'If this pain bring us together
'Then what greatness we reap of the true bounty

After the hours of fasting that followed themsleves cleansed-via-vomit

They took their always_packed-packs & left Downtown
Instead of the left turn towards the Dunes
Jewels lead them to her old school in Uptown

Miss began her long story
'The Duties were old-dike-identical-twins
'Boot-stomping-bruisers bristly as hefty-english-boars

'So loud was their march that it was near impossible to take the duo seriously
'Assigned to babysit a shool

'As decades passed the women were finally put to the true test
'An abductor of no small size atempted an idea that would end his life 

'The jarhead beaten to death in a-half-n-hour-struggle
'Scars on their face still bore testament to the battle

'Faces of Death covers the last-leathal-10-min-of-the-brawl
'But word is the first twenty were ghastly what recorded only a tired-end

'The kidnap'd girl ran crying up to the two women in gratitude

'That girl was our Jewels when she was 5
'OhMyGod was it a sight from the binoculars of the Penthouse
'Whiskey & Tennessy-man oh it was magical to end

'Back to the story the dikes were coughing up blood
'They took photos and ever since people knew
'Do not fk with the Twins
'Hollywood's film already made top charts

'The hilarious part
'The police didn't attempt to intervene that gorilla of a man was good-&-dead 

In that fame the women reigned-never-checked 
But they never step out of line either

'Old age has its toll
'Beauty must sleep 

'3:30 - 3:45 Neither keep their eyes open
'The lure of that sweet rest & blissful wakefulness

'If you see two woman coming at you
'Jewels begs you to drop the bikes & run
 
'We have ten minutes lets go

(what)

'We came here to steal these bikes
'Pick one out come on you don't want to get face-stomped

They dove in the lot 
Snuck under the booth 
Where on-que slept the two

Every action was worrisome for them 
Jewels stitched face & unseeming passager
City authorities already on the alert to get them

This venture had to pull of smooth or they wered fk'd

Have'n singlehandedly cause their school to be shut down forever 
Jordan said the deaths were caused by the sent from the blood Todd left as a trail

They could only hope Jewels was smart about this move

Stressed persperation bloomed from their palms
To their surprise Jewels confindence pulled thru

The lot of bikes were open for the take'n
Unchained by the confidence in the Duties who knew the owner of each bike

big small large brite pimp
A selection unparalleled by any shop

Several bikes on the front gold-colored rack grouped together
All other bikes allowed respectful space

Jules went immediately & lifted the foremost-bike on her off shoulder 
She held the pedal with her hand

Miss chripped
'We are ready hurry hurry rats

Her bike was the leader's
It was a tricked-to-shit bmx bike 

Todd took the practical road-bike
Looked sturdy after a decade of use

Ben hoisted up a rugged mountain-bike
The puffy tires had a relentless attitude

Jordan was sweating under his load

(are you fkn serious)

The four whispered in unison
The pimp-ed out bike was ostentacious

Here wasn't the place to debate
They swiftly headed out

Following Jewel's hand motions
Silent directions & kept the bikes from making noise

Unobstructed back out on the streets within 5 min

After the corner turn they shouted & hooted
High speed down hill on bikes fit for them

Too-high-speed each began to try and speed-wobble away from the other
But they stayed true in the end

Blasted onto the coastline
The fourbikes bullied lanes

Jordan on a lowriding bike set in all chrome lights-pimped-out 
His kicked-back position drew his left lip in a look of coolness
His pack bound on top of the front tire

By the time they came off the high they were bayside 
Front bonfire before night-sky at the Dunes

They could only piece back the earlier events
Greatful of the plunder & busy taking notes on the insights give to them in the trip

Todd kept all their dealings in a record which he kept without fail 
_

They all stared at Todd's replication of the DIAGRAM Jewels drew when they drank her brew
Drawn on a virgin part of the dunes at South Moon

Jewels never kept from work 
Produced the brew she made memorized by Miss

Able to fly free on their own island
All attention on the moment

Each have'n lost & gained worth longlasting contemplation 
Lonely states allow the soul to be susceptible to higher states of being
Reenforced by the rubble of demolished states of being

The diagram was singular in fashion & make
Magnetic bonds pulled them tangibly to sit in their placements

Miss began
'I believe this was contact by other beings who reached out to us via quantum-connections
'I understand us to be connected by quantum bonds to kindred spirits

'The bond is a constant proof of infinity as distance is of null impact
'The bonds attracted in sleep to experience the lives of others as Silent Passangers

'Dagon, we are taught is the god of universe
'His echo from AEons       
'His might truth

'Nations seek to call him forth as a gateway to divine gifts
'Tho all their world stripped upon his arrival

'The distance that seperates the cosmos is unfathomable

'Quantum properties testify that all realities come to pass that are passable

'When one acts to create possibility
'One creates universes & reworks destiny

'Possibility Severance happens when two liknesses diverge to irrevocable paths
'Cases have been made for two sects: Chaos & Order

'The distance tween cosmos is unbreachable 
'Aun for the Holy Dagon

'Each life has the power infinitely stronger to breah the barrier of distance
'To contact the other thru human spirit consortium

'All hearts to power the other in a robust network
'That act together but physically alone

'This power when grouped by massive actions
'Can open the portal to allow Dagon God thru

'Pulling him to their location to feast

'Thru ancient traditions passed down by the ages
'We reknewn tonight the Artes of Occult Cosmos Projection

'A rite learned & perfected to directly communicate 
'Experience to be shared across many realities

'This DIAGRAM given to us is the public gate 
'Our private understand'n & connection with the symbols is the key

'If we are lured by dangerous hands the symbol will betray the trap 
'You will find each is their own-worst-enemy

'Each in an Order of Ourself for Chaos or Order 
'To focus them inward as a check of four proofs

'The Five of us strong together each as coner for other
'Our rite will be our position we assumed earlier

'We will bind our hands & sleep 
'By purchase of comfort we will attain a way to project to other realities that do the same
'Able to learn on a scale of infinity which will all confirm singularity in a situation

Position tho uncomfortable laid-natural as if only need a nudge to fall full swing
All woke each in a different quantum reality in Lucid Dreams

All the world was inside a dome of earth 
Illuminesent roots dangle'n drip'n light from the roof 

? a massive volcano covered all with no breach in the barrier

The plants glowed in shining marvels
Each plant different 
Each uniquely-florescent in mathematical patterns

In primal joy of a hack-n-slash tunnel 
The boy swinging a giant sword that passed thru uncontested

'My dog
'I need to find my dog
'I pass my voice to you

The movement was hurried but the pace of endurance  
A steady of subborness that carried a hopeless heart

The boy stopped to make a impatient-questioning-gesture

Plants plenty burst a warm slushy tastfulness of sticky goo Ben was sure was an intoxicant
Each bite was gorgeous but none allowed him a sense of fulfillment

'Dogs
'Dogs logically gravitate towards high corners in a dome like this
'Echoes will seem to originate from each large corner and call to the dog naturally 

The epiphany was a burst of joy to the boy
Unexpected with a sudden bloom of home

A silent passager had spoke thru a vocal passerger 

The elation knocked hime up with a force
Todd bolt'n up still cuffed

000000 BEN    00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Darkness 
Darkness but a candle

No he was turnt towards dark walls with sections of different colors
His hands worked fast over many keyboards 
All laid on the massive workbench facing the wall

Lurch'n into a roll around in a chair

clickity clack clak 

Colorful code displayed on various terminals
Each reviewed over and over

Ben could follow and understand logic
Tho it was in the syntax of an alien language

Characters would pour down the wall as waterfall 
Each to fill him with satisfaction never so deep

The man would immediately push on to the next after the current task complete
Allow'n Ben to digest & comment passively

Ben could tell he was smoking weed out of a box-vaporizor on the bench
'Give me guidance 
'I have gone as far as I can 

With a swift habitual movement his hands made sign
Cut out a symbol in the wood workbench
sun-pose => fall => inhale-smoke-rise => hand-sign => lower-exhale
_

Ben's eye jerked open darkened by Todds shadow siting up
The fire was longsince burnt out and he was cold under a bright moon

Many a long-time-coffee-session in remembrance of the example of that night

000000 JORDAN 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Work every second a drag
New customer same complaint

New room 
Same mop

In & out 
In a dreary life

Forced by the system this way with no escape
On pentance for being too poor as child-of-the-state

Believe in yourself
You can survive alone

Take heart & leave this all behind
Your older brother can go to hell for steal'n your last paycheck

Boss here is a one-of-a-kind muthrfkr
Use your next paycheck to get 

a pack, bed, tarp, & weapon
You only have to do it

All will work itself naturally

It took another five years
But that advice was followed

000000 JEWELS 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

She was radiant under sunrays that sparkled off her hair, off her eyes, that bounced from her wet tongue to framed mirror
The bike hop'd onto the rail and skid down trail'n sparks

I shouted partly aroused 
There a deep well of sexual desire to be cast with Jewels in forbidden love

I was wear'n roadbike cleats that clicked metalically with each step

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

All awoke with Todd
But all felt in control

Time they understood was null
As if without gravity warps away lines of traditional perception

'This symbol here 
Ben redrew the polygon sign from the dream 

'This means something to me now I can feel it      
'I want
'I need to tatoo it on my knuckles

Jewels steadied-by-her-lack-of-empathy-for-pain
With root of an herb & ink of octopus 
The diagram beautifully portrayed upon Ben's left fist

With a natural sunbleached spine she worked upon his hands a mixture 
Augmented by Miss who together made the masterpiece
Ben's fist in black-symbols which turned to a light-brown-red under the sun

The project became an ordeal which never stopped
Symbols & Shapes expounded from knuckles up the arm
Amplified in pattern by each dream
_

Friday night set for ordeals of longsufferring adventures
They would do rites of fume induced sleep upon the Dunes the night-prior

To wakeful dusks that set calm stages as passive scenes for their worked desires

Adventure mostly returned them to the city
For four days they would migrate thru Jordans many spots

City life was necessary to trade for goods
Jewels made aroma-therapy candles that she parted off at high prices

Water wasn't plentiful at the Dunes nor was the enviornment kind to plants
Miss had informed them of Jewels idea to grown her own plants

Massive acres of farmland would be ideal places to plant where they would be watered under ample sun

True power of plant-magik only unlocked thru the engeries spent towards the plant's growth
To reap its fruits but never its body in a state of affection

Jewels had a slew of month old plants
Each had one now nested on their bikes

Jordan had constructed a one-wheel trailer for this low-rider
His load was the most but the laid back position kept the high winds off him

The agitation on the plants would present long lasting danger which would instill in them insecurity 
Roots would grip with a steadfastness that would empower them on plentiful plains 
_

Across town & down endless roads

Each truck pass'n honk'n at them
In saying they were strangers

Rolling together in pack 
Holligans up to no good

The plants probably drugs
_

Hours passed into moonlight
Jewels finally stopped the pack

Miss affirmed with a sense of pride
'Yes there is deep water in the air
Jewels arms skyward outstrech'd soaked in the energy

Bikes were stashed inside the overgrown streetside drainage
Jordan always covered them with a dark tarp he locked with his handy-chain

'Bikes always will betray their location with a sparkle if any part is exposed 
'Lets see someone manage to lift four-awkwardly-place-bikes-locked-in-tarp
Jordan was always up to his practical ingenuities that bore him confidence

Jewels carried her pepper plant
The strand a variation of her own of the Witch's main root
Peppers kept off parasites, peppers helped keep meat, leaves produced thick smoke

10 Acres they walked along a fence 
Bugs bit at their salty-sweaty-bodies in a frenzy

A small hill held a resivor of water
Leakage made the path difficult

Muddy
Bit 
Cut by anti-social-plants

They fought thru a path decades old
Jordan pointed at the rusted hinges on the gate they easily hurdled

More signs of long abadonment appeared
An old camp chair was next to a rusted-thru-tin-bin full of decades-old-crushed-beer-cans

Strewn about were odds that spoke of a person who used this place as a private-quarters 

Miss commented still worn from the journey
'It must have been misery to choose this mosquito-infested-parcel as lounge

'This is definitely manmade
Jordan said assured by certain molds of the hill that had longsince-become-organic

They twisted & curved in a path that hid their direction 
Plants were too thick & greedy for space
_

Foliage 10-feet-high at some places
The summit broke into a grassy knoll 

Open & impossibly-larger-than-what-looked-possible-from-below

The water was a small pond flush with the ground
'One would think it a hole too dark to be ventered carelessly
'Till they notice their reflection mirrored back at them 
'In soft ripples of night darkened waters
Miss had a habit of annoying them with her poetry

'The plaque at the Downtown memorial described 
'How difficult of a process to engineer a perfect-water-mirror

Under full-harvest-moon at perfect reflection

No buzz of bug nor intrusive plant 

The grass untamed by man retained a lush kentucky green, cool & soft 
Blades of it didn't cut the skin; it clung as moistured-gauze
The face of it a balm to tired & bit & sunbaked flesh

Two hours past
Plants aside the manmade waterhole

All unknowingly let themselves be drifted off to quantum realms in inescapable sleep

All looked across to the other
Each sat legs crossed & settled comfortably

A large wick candle blazed crackily
Smoke thick cloudy with a heavy mint aroma
A controlled fire bured a couldron 

There was a omnious sound that isnt-at-first-heard
It crept upon their awakening concious 

'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh

All were sync'd of mouth
There was no Miss on Jewels

Jewels eyes burst widely open

'They have arrived to our call

'Welcome all four
'3 long years we
'Chanted out for thee

'Many have come & gone
'But you we only seek

'I am the Grand Prophet Jewels
Jewels spoke in a firm beauty
Adorned in all fine things

'My kin on santified planes
'Exchanged their voice for mine

'My voice is true & worth their sacrifice
'A monks life was not my companion's choice but given

'In sacrifice to bless infinite realms
'As echo I beseeched thee 
'To aid thee in meeting in thine realm

'Dagon now lured to your land
'Thru your reality to infect all of our realities

'All efforts ever made by this Earth's existence will be null
'In the infinite gluttony as all possiblities presented as feast

'You must stop it
'I have forseen you will

One woke slowly
Entranced by chant

A sound that slowly-woke-them

Dryness of mouth 
Welled up to deep tears of agony

Each across the other
Crossed on sore legs

All drug themselves heavily
To the banks of of the resivour

Not for hours did they speak
Jewels too put out to setup a healing-vapor

All of them put out 
Passed out on-and-off

All looked at Jewels with wonder

Miss still asleep out to a distant cold
The instant Jewels woke Miss collapsed of exhaustion

Jewel's death averted but still an hard-amount of dried-caked-blood 

Three days & nights they had sat 
Pulled from body to bridge the connection

A powerful Jewels had dealt them great harm 
To wretch them in so great a suffer-unparallel

Two days they lay on that grass
Contemplating the message that cost the agony

Grass nurtured them under unabated sun

Miss only a broken form
Old woken to a new hell
The greatest shock in old age

Saggy as a tumorous rasin
Each full of pity for wrongs against her

Two-weeks-torment ferried Miss to death's gate 
Waning Harvest Moon 
Tide as never seen 
Great waves splashed in tears

All around a ceremonial-pyre

Burning Miss 
In the comsic burial of the flame

Drift wood piled high
Gulf wind as great engine

The flame strong all night
_

Themselves they found
Were ones greatest enemy
