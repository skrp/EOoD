! Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers that lined empty-halls

15 Minutes past the Bell
That point-of-no-return to class

Any student this late would get writ-up
Ironically worse than not arriving at all 

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail

His purpose was in the basement
To the door he planned to open

Latency becomes mounted by endless-anticipation
That energy from day-dreaming now as a hurdle
Aun compelled him towards the opposite direction

The thump of Todd's feet steady 
Step after step up stairs to higher floors

It was a peace appreciated
In a place only-ever bustling-loudly

The few rays of the sun 
Bore thru only to show 
Dust pollute'n the air 
_

The mellow ambience shattered as 
Patters of run'n feet charged towards his direction 
From around the corner

Fortune had placed Todd 
Directly opposite of the girls restroom

The distance was leapt in one bound 
He rushed to the last stall

Todd let out a cocky smirk 
Of the ingenuity of hiding in the girls

!! KAK 

The cracked-seat broke plunging his left-foot ankle-deep into hour-old piss & shit
He caught his balance with his arms to save the other foot

The door quietly opened
Someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled yell came from the hallway 
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

!! BOOM 

Heavy legs near-cracked-the-door-in-half 

That unexpected fright broke unprecedented-pressure into full-release

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSPPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP

The entire school vibrated 
With the overwhelming sound 
Of a prolonged-volcano-blast 

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN YOU SHOULDA SAID WHY 
!!! YOU NEEDED THE GIRLS 

One of the schoolhall-monitors hooted out for-the-entire-building-to-know 

The last of this announcement was gagged-quiet as gas particles bloomed-out in a thick cloud
_

The room was silent after the door fell shut and resettled
The building now rumbled gigglng 

!! PAT 
!! PAT 
!! PAT 

Ben kicked at the stall door braced-shut by legs
'Gonna make your fat-cunt-ass 
'Eeat that shit you scabby bitch

Todd stepped out of the stall
'Back off

Ben turned to him even more crazed

!YOU   

Todd was tackled to the wall 
Slaming hard as his wet foot slipped out

Ben muffled as he struggled out his revenge
'You are the reason I got chased

'walk'n around
'like you weren't skipping class

'a teacher notified 
'the monitors and got me chased down 

Todd manuevered around using Ben's force against him
Then with his forearms placed Ben in a locked-hold 

After several curses 
And a long pause 
Ben surrendered
'Alright asshole you made your point

Todd pushed Ben off to a safe distance
A toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that
Jordan blushed-out the awkward introduction
'Im sick

Today would haunt Ben's reputation a long time
For a while they were content with breathing the gas in silence 
_

Walls washed white layer-after-layer
Exentuated by the dark recesses between the tiles
Unable to conceal the deep-red of the grafitti symbols
That were easily visible when seen as a whole

Piss marked all to a feminine territory 
If only the stain but mostly the smell
Curiosity here only met horrors 

Ben broke the silence 
'This place is kinda creepy
All of them had been repelled from investigations

High-hot-boxed in a room full of fumes
No where to go until the class period ended

A sound tickled Todd's ear
It was a charming type
It drew him closer to the wall
Before he realized he was interested

Todd was startled then reaffirmed

'There is a hum 
'That sounds like a whimper
'Can you guys hear it

Jordan put in as he neared 
'Probably a ghost

He yelled at the trash-can playfully
'This school is hella haunted

Todd motioned them to the second-vent 
Next to the garbage-can

The rust smeared as Todd opened the lid for better acoustics
'It comes from this trash-vent

Suddenly Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

( need help help please help )

The sound came softened from great distance
But with a fullness-of-scream 
That rips apart throat-lining

The communication so faint 
Todd looked to the others for confirmation

( help us    please )

Jordan ventured  
'Here      
'we are here
'Where are you

( can you hear me  hello please help )

Jordan continued 
'We hear you
'We will get the Principal

( noooooooooooo ! )

The shriek took all three back in a tight terror
Pitch-to-curl-ear-hairs in absolute revoltion

( they did this to her! )

Todd opened the lid with both his hands to shout down
'Who ever you are
'Where ever you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately
The others followed dazed 

To them it seemed 
A reckless promise

At 10-min-to-the-bell 
The hall is at its most empty
Policy prohibits anyone out-in-the-hall 

The trio made their way without obstruction 
The Monitors would be back in their lounge on the couch

'I discovered a secret door 
'When I got lost my first-year fire-drill

'All year I been trying to work myself 
'Up to this before graduation 

'No chance ever came up
'So today I promised
'I would force the action

Todd was the only-one-he-knew that had seen that long-corridor
Despite years he still believed in what he had seen

'I spent the past 2 years dreaming about exploring it

'Today is too much of a coincidence
'That door will lead us to them 

The three boys followed the stairwells down
A small pack not-to-be-fucked-with

Crossed lengths of halls 
Of the first year students

Todd continued
'When I got lost 

'I felt someone calling out to me by-name 
'I followed tho less-than-a-handful knew my name

'I found a door at the end of the hall 
'It was unlocked
'At first i only peaked in out of curiosity 

'At the back of the closet 
'There was a lightsource instead of shadow

'I had time to wander
'I went to the back to see a long corridor

'The path went on for a long time 
'It ended at a black hole in a wall

'I am sure it leads down 
'But I forced myself to go back 
'Before I got near enough to know

'Goddam-creepy-place

Todd looked ahead determined
The pent-up-forces now-unleashed 
Propelled him forward

Jordan stirred with the brisk walk expounded
'I did research on this school for most my papers

'This floor is suposed to be the basement

'Right so with that-in-mind
'There was one article of a peculiar-incident

'A boy was found brutally-seperated in a satanic-ritual
'The article said the incident was found out by the janitor
'The Recession took his home & he slept at school 

'The article mentions the location as the 3rd-Basement floor 
'That could be considered a typo caz there is only one basement

'But at the time there were only two levels
'University Hospital was built on top of the school 
'An entire decade later

'It is one of the few articles that made world-papers
'The paper is one of the most reknown 

'The crazy thing is that no other papers
'Retained a copy of that date in their archives

Ben countered at the steamrolling logic
'I been here all 3 years of school

'If there was a sub basement there would be some proof
'A reworked stairwell that meets up with the other stairwells
'There would be left structural pillars
'With three basements those pillars 
'Cant just be shifted

Ben's logic was solid but life seldom follows logic
'You both believe that a stairwell could just disappear
'These stairwells were created by god on the 8th-day for fks-sake
_

The exterior wall in the corner of the basement held a closet door
Todd's sweaty palms slid on the locked knob

A narrow closet was exposed by the small window

'Let me get this
Jordan knelt in front
Took off his pack
Retrieved a pouch

The door was open and pack back on Jordan's back 
Before the other two could follow the action 

Once inside the back after the brooms & mops
A corridor was revealed to turn down a very-long-hallway

The narrow corridor followed the exterior wall

Single-file in the errie-way of knowing 
An action would change life forever

Ben said as endorphins flowed 
In bounty of an oft asked question
'I always thought it was odd there were no small windows 
'In any of the rooms on the basement 
'So this is the real outer wall
'They rather built that new northside-stairwell
'Caz the Fire Marshall made them

The walls made of the pilgrim-old-brick
Large & thick & dark-purple
_

The tunnel was bare
It held no purpose
No back doors to any classrooms

It only continued 
Long-passage-after-long-passage

The end came up abruptly 
As a blank wall

Ben chirp'd
'The architect must have been a comedian

Jordan countered
'Or a way to hide access to an entire level in a closet
'This bay was too huge to tame for early history

'Pirates frequently raided 
'This building is right along their path 
'Often they kidnapped children

'Thats why we have that motto
'Once a Buc
'Always a Fk

Ben noticed on the old bricks
Symbols carved in peculiar diagrams 
The spraw of it was typical of angry graffiti

Todd's nails finally scraped against the wall 
He found the fine line only by difficulty

Jordan moved him out of the way 
He went to work with a thin steel bar

The peeled-paint revealed a metal door 
2ft above-the-ground 3ft high-and-wide

'Sheiit

'We get caught back here
'Might as well go all-in
'Right from the start

'whothafk knows crazy sheiit
'These kid-fucking muthrfkrs up to
'fkdesmuthafkrs bustaskull & shit

Todd took the bar from Jordan 
A little too swiftly to betray the worry

Jordan raised an eyebrow
Only content to let Todd do the rest of the work

They all helped pry the hinges into creaked-submission

Somehow Todd always knew this went down
Now he saw into the black depths

The door had the lock from the inside 
The fall of it down the shaft shaft
Tinkled bangs for a long long time

'Pilgrims were paranoid muthrfkrs

Ben looked at Jordan
'Wouldn't you be

Jordan smirked back

?Be

'Hell Im way worse
'My locks dont bend
_

Dark musty air flowed immedately to them 
Strong-as-a-gulf-breeze
Hot as if a furnace vent

Something caught Todd's eye
He poked at it with the bar

Elevator-cords hung in the mid hidden by darkness
'If there are 3 lower basements 
'Then there are two floors to explore

An exchange of glances agreed compliance

Jordan looked casual 
Ben looked like he would not back down

Todd reached with extended-arm and grasped the cord
In a hard pull he let himself be drawn into the darkness

Todd's hands began to slide 
At first a slight 
Then after he passed the length of his body
He rapidly descended screaming

!!! HAILMARYFULLOFGRACE
_

All was dark 
Distance only an abstract measurment

Movement only testified by the-burning-of-his-palms
Sweat-sprung as will-fought-for-life

Todd ventured his legs out 
He managed to stop himself into near splits

!!! TODD

The other two screamed frantically down

Todd looked up 
The door only a small smudge of silver
In the infinity of dark space 


'Im okay
'Im okay

'There is oil on the cords
'I should have expected it

'Gonna take off my shirt 
'Use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

Ben asked automatically 
Without idea on how to back up the offer
'Do you need help up

Todd fearless began to climb at a controlled rate
'Its best only one person 
'Be on the cord at the same time

'Im gonna try 
'To find a door 
'To get to one of the lower floors
'I fell pretty far
'So Im guess'n up
_

Todd didn't notice any doors in the commotion down

The best course would be to climb up slowly 
To ensure he could get back up

He would feel for an open'n with this feet

The slide down had cleared off most of the oil
His hands now had clean purchase

The only sound was his breath and the swell of air
The gusts came intesnse 
Rising with the heat-from-deep-darkness

Todd felt a gust on his stomach
It was cool & didn't come from below
He stomped out the outline of the door

! TWANG
! TWANG

A beam bore into the darkness

'I think

! I found it

With one hand he felt for a handle
The door was there, he could feel the cold metal

!! POMP 
!! POMP 

Todd stomped the corner down 
He pulled himself higher 
Kicking-down until the door gave way

He pulled himeself into the dusty grey hallway

'Im off the cords 
'Come down

'Wrap your shirt around your hands
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Jordan challendged
'Best just stay back
'Something get loose and fall
'Right into your face

Ben & Jordan followed down and swiftly entered

Ben, last, climbed inside scraping his knee
Looking up saw Todd and shrieked back falling-on-his-ass

! FUCK

Todd was covered in dusk-caked dark-blood-mud
Blood not oil had been on the cords

Smears were left where Todd had touched himself
Jordan hadn't taken much notice of it

The sub-basement had no light
But the sliver of the dust
Seemed to repeat up
What avaliable light there was
When eyes adjust to the dark
_

This level was an abandoned hospital
All lay as if it had been unexpectedly sealed off

Dust caked everywhere 
Jordan could easily see their tracks back
They went forward in a cautious adventurous manner

Electricity still flowed on this floor
Emergency signs gave enough light for them to move secure

Ben told them
'That shaft went the length of the building
'This must be where they deposit all the bodies from the hospital
'But that explanation doesn't make much sense

Jordan continued
'It doesn't make much sense 
'To have a hospital as a secret basement

'I expect a fkn-mid-Evil-sex-dungeon

At the end of the first hall 
Jordan looked into a room
On the bed was a familiar form

'Hold up

Jordan walked inside the room 
Only a bed pan & a flipped-over bed
With a swift fling he threw off the blanket

A long decayed corpse lay there turnt-off the-fallen-bed
The smell stung their noses sweetly

The horror was simple
No screams or fear of life
Only a complete confidence that their life was in danger
_

A loud-clang, shuffle and meaty-wacks where heard 
A hoarse voice rose but was immedately silenced 

The boys took shelter in the room
A corpse for company

But the day had long-since
Numbed their nostrils

Jordan whispered
'Doesn't make sense
'Water from the tap
'Electricity

Ben
! Snap

He took off his pack
Using the blanket as tent

Plugged into power
Plugged into a raw-network

Jordan & Todd
Both the third-wheel

Rather look at the corpse
Than each-other as they waited-out

Its hair over-grown 
Its jaw dangled stoopidly

As if its hollow eyes held a truth
That was mystery to present company

Someone was trapped & beaten 
In the concealed sub-basement of the school

The authorities would no-doubt 
Do likewise to the trio of boys

In an abandonded level
Layers from escape
With only one known exit - an elevator shaft

Mousecraft was the sure way to go about these things
Patience & longwait'n until absolute vacancy was established

Jordan an expert in this craft
For the entire period they waited 

The bells could still be faintly-heard
The silence was a time of meditation

Accept the drastic turn of this Friday morn
Be ready to decide upon actions with dire-consequences
_

Their eyes & senses now accustomed they proceeded

The halls were built in the same structure of their school
One large hall circled the outside classrooms and inner classrooms

All told obvious signs 
This area-of-the-basement was not used

Jordan guided their search 
He tracked the dust 
To know how long since last-passage

The inside of rooms 
The highest-end in the vacancy-spectrum:

Untouched -> long-since -> this-month -> this-week -> today 
_

Jordan now was on a path that was taken daily

One head-of-the-path led to a stairwell
They followed the other head
Towards a large-open-room inner-room

It dropped low into a deep arena

Workstations arrayed the entire space

A industrial-lamps draped over each stone table 
Shiney-rungs were embedded as obvious retraint ports

Under each table were various shelves for various instruments

Jordans heart fainted 

All the tools 
In all the stations 
Down all the rows 
Had-been-used-recently

The room had been used this month for a massive operation

The only daily path led to a table at center-stage 
The only table with its light on
_

Strapped to the table by a broad-leather-belt 
Was a nude-red-headed-girl

So bruised was her face it was impossible to see her freckles

Freckles covered her entire body
Freckled to the point that tho bloody, bruised & nude 

All was only the second characteristic noticed
After the infinte amount of cherry-colored-dots

She had stich-patch-openings all over her torso
Patches appeared in similar fashion all over her body

Her shut-eyes sprang into maniacal-alertnesss 
Two large yellow-orbs

Three boys, not monsters, stood over her

Jordan was unable to free any strap
'How to we get these loose

Confused past-exhasperated he repeated
'How the fk 
'Do I get these off

Yelling stupidly at the world
But really aimed at the girl

She screamed just recently
Now she can't even talk

Jewels looked back at him
She opened display
A mutilated-stump-of-a-tongue-in-a-wag

The stump was fresh
It had an odd-seal as if it was seared

A small muffled voice came to fullness
'Finally sorry 
'I cant speak 
'Hardly-breathe when she lays like that

'Don't you move like that neanderthal
'I need to get ready to introduce us
'A hundred years will teach you patience bitch

Infantile hands pushed its way out of a tangle of hair 
A creature emerged: a shrunken-head with two baby-arms attached
_

The trio looked agast 
The girl had a monster perched on her shoulder

'Yes this is a shock I understand
The little head said in a small voice

Jewels cast her face-to-the-side-ashamed

Nude & openly disfigured 
Took over her perdicament as most-painful

The little head made a-small-exhasperated-sound 
'How are you such a bitch all the time
'I can find you a new-tongue 
'A longer one if you are into-that
'You had much worse now

! we-gotta-get-the-fk-outta-dodge

'The bands are one leather belt
'Hurry there is not a second to spare

'Above our head you can release it 
'Hurry hurry you rats

'Jewels cannot speak & I can't read her mind
'But I can sense what she is feeling
'She feels ashamed of me right now
The puppeted-head trailed on

It took a small roll of paper out of a back of the shrunken-head
Before she started to read she ordered

'Lets get moving

Jordan found the clasp to be odd-shaped 
Only after some ingenuity was it released

All with the help of the metal bar and 6 arms

Jordans shirt was the least dirty
Jewels wore it as a small dress
Missy had them make a measurement & a cut
To tailor the shirt to mold to her-form

Ben's shoes didn't fit her only his socks

'We need to hurry the goons will be back soon
'If we are still subterranean when that happens 
'Each one of us will be strapped down
 
Promptly they made exodus from that devilish auditorium 

The light had a cruel elderly-tint-of-aged-desperation 
The rays seemed to follow them in a-haunting-fashion as-if-pointing-direction
Vengeful that what they have accepted must be held true unto-all
_

The elevator-cord now clean enough to allow them quick-access back up to the basement

Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their perdicament

Todd was smeared over in blood
Thin-streams ran down his face like bloody-tears

Jordan was shirtless
His odd-shaped-belly buldged-out 

All were caked in dust

& Then there was Jewels

Ben admitted despair
'How the fk are we going to get out of school
'They are going to know where we have been immediately
'Put us back down there at all costs

Jordan wailed
'Fk they will just say
'It was another goddamndrill

'I have a plan
Todd opened the closet door 
And walked into the school hall

Dusty 
Shirtless 
Pantless 
Bloody

They broke into the hall cast from horror  

Sharply outlined to a monotony-of-normal-scenes 
The view more contrast by their outlandish forms 

Todd had a plan in mind 
A preplanned route of exit

They made it to the end of the hall in the basement
A teacher stopped her lecture 
She opened the door and yelled

!!! MONITOR
!!! MONITOR SECTION 7

!!! 559

The call for all students to plaster against hall-windows
In a mosh-pit of greedy kids

Starving for 1st-hand-account
Daydreaming off the earlier shitshow fireworks

Brewed in the lunch-meal-meds
Now in a riot in each young-heart

The four spectacted only by classmates 
Turned the corner to rush up the stairwell

The teachers in this way were barred from looking out

Two large Monitors stood as sentinels 
In locked-down-protocol at the-main-exit

!!! MONITORS 
!!! SECTION 1

Two voices boomed

But Todd already turnt
Leading them up stairwells across the level 

There was no time to explain 
Only for Todd to choose and the rest to follow

Cross the school in this method 
All Monitors would be drawn to the wrong location

Their exit was higher-up school-levels
Not at the ground-floor as expected
_

Every window filled 
Every door blocked 

Curious-children stirred by shouts
Starved-sight of the spectation 
Charged by an eventful-day

This the factor 
Allowed the five to get to the second-floor unhindered

Jordan pulled out his bar 
'This-deep-in-it
'Now is the rekon'n

'Suggest you wake-up likewise

Ben took the hint
He had a second-purpose for his laptop-computer

They passed the restroom of the morn
Towards the end of the hall

Jordan took out a key from his pocket & unlocked the window
'Just do what I do and go where I go

They climbed onto a narrow ledge outside
The sun shone hotly on them 
They burned under it with exhaustion

The world around them too-busy-with-the-day to notice 
Four-odd-bodies outside on the second-story

The ledge continued to an adjacent roof 
They crossed over to a high-branched tree

The branch overhung onto the roof in an entangled attachment

By that means they climbed down to the ground-level 
At the back of the school

Onward into alleys
Led them to the less traveled roads

Each of the boys knew how to pass-this-area without-being-seen
They ran tired but they knew this-stage was their-turf

They new which fences led where
Up which buildings to what

Rat-true
Now they could not get caught

Jewels only had a large shirt & Ben's sweaty socks
But large city bustlers continued their way without heed 
The four moved in a pack following Jordan's lead
_

They arrived at the edge of Downtown 
The outskirts of the industrial-sector 

Jordan turned them into an alley 
& Thru a chain-linked-fence 
He loosed an opening & then bound-it-back

Thru a locked-window they quickly entered
The edifice was as dusty as the sub-basement

They cautiously followed Jordan's movements 
Hopping from board-to-board
Their trace with few tracks 
Up the stairs to a room

Jordan locked the room with a chain after they entered 
He then pushed away a cabinet to reveal another chain-locked door

'This far from anyone 
'I like to be triple-sure so I can sleep 

'Break'n thru any of these
'Loud enough to wake whatever sleep

An outside window exposed the endless ocean
Dust free & ocean breeze 

Jordan led them thru the window 
To a ledge that was covered by patched-tarps

The floor was of netted-metal 
A repurposed fire-escape

'I got a tank of rain water
Jordan motioned with his hands

'Open the spout 
'& Close it with this knob

He motioned them to turn around
'It aint clear-water 
'but cleaner than you 

He took a brisk wash in water heated-by-the-sun
The water splashed far below 

Ben asked Jordan 
'So what is this place

He just washed & laid on the tatami

Jordan looked-down as his face blushed
'This is one of the places I go to live

They showered with Todd last
As he was so bloody
_

Refreshed & completely exhausted 

All laid on layers of cardboard-stiched japanese-tatami

Ocean gusts massaged their tense skin
All slept till the next morn

In safe slumbers 
Soothed by the-sound-of-steady-waves

Jordan fed them dried fruit & granola 
Desert was a Mtn-Dew

'Got locations like this 
'All over the city

'Not as night as this one
'Tho each has a stash of all I need

'Last week I was stuck across town 
'I ate bad food I stashed 
Jordan finished looking apologetically at Ben
All that now mostly forgotten by the day

!fk

Ben realized his perdicament with this father

His father would be ready with a self-righteous beating 

It was Saturday morn
From Friday-morn to now seemed a trance he woken suddenly
_

Jordan trailed their exit
Covering their tracks as they returned to the streets

'Take everything 
'I never go to the same place in the same week

Ben needed to get to the payphone at the lower-district Circle-K

The day was warming to be hot

The heat relaxed overworked-muscles
After a prolonged-stiff-sleep

Ben wondered why the monster hadn't woke them
She just let them sleep till morn

Ben looked at Todd
'We only have enough for one call
'You mind if I use it

Todd complied
'I am the last of the litter 
'My parents wouldn't know if I was gone for a week

Jordan had a rummage-of-clothes at that place
Raided from the downtown charity 

Jewels was head-to-toe with garments that mostly fit
She had hiking-sandals with wool stockings
The light-blue summer-dress only-a-little-too-short 

That morn her
& Miss the monster
Tailored the outfit with repuposed-stockings for her arms

Miss always held a finely-made extendable-umbrella
This would bar anyone from seeing what was quick-to-hide

Jordan now wore a pocketed vest
Ben took an old-leather-jacket
Todd took a set of wool gloves for his hands

The shrunken head had stayed silent since their escape 
It held the umbrella 
'unoffended

The pressing pace of life left Jewels 
Still to be sorted out
_

After 4 rings 
Ben tried the oldman's next-door

This wasn't the first time
This exact thing has happened

The old voice responded
'Heeh Hello

'Mr. Grinvix this is Ben 
There was no response for some time

'I just wanted to call to ask about my dad
'He isnt answer'n the phone
'If you see him can you tell him I got a way home

Ben waited awkwardly 
Only the sound of heavy breath'n

'Your dad
'is dead boy

'You best get to the authorities 
'an have 'em tell ya

The voice was sympathetic but immediately hung up 

Ben stood silent leaving the phone to his ear
Flabbergasted from truth-revealed-lie

? His dad would always be there

A jackass who tried hard to keep light of heart
To never-again hit him nor give him advice-no-other-could

Regretful of being a father who was stuck with a son
Man enough to power thru that hardship
That too-often-than-not he was the cause 

Ben physically-worked to come-to-grips

Understandings toppled down
Dazed among rubble

The four in slience left him space to wail
_

!!! PLUUPP 
!!! PLUPPP 

A police car had silently snuck up behind the crew
Its lights now bright at their backs

'Alright you juuhhhh 

The cop cut short as the pack immediately bolted

He turned & fumbled open the door he had preemptively shut

Today was not the mood
'Im gonna bust their diaphrams
'fkn-lil-shit-fks

The officer called into his shoulder-piece

'Broc here
'I got a 281 on that 48f
'Update the 48f is now a 49f 

He reversed with sirens blareing
Confident he didn't need to look back 

His focus-as-predator never dropping target 

In that action he was fused into the corner-store 

An overworked-trucker plowed
Near a ton of Coca-Colas in trailer 

An unstoppable mountain
Until about 15-feet in

Flesh crunched in sharp folds of metal
Soaking Dorito-chips like salsa
& Drowning to a cold-death under Slurpee
_

Todd looked back in relief 

That cop coming
Must have been the result
Of Ben calling his neighbor

The timing on the cop
Made sense if dispatched from Downtown-Station

What was this all about?
Did it have to do with Ben?
Or is this a result of yesterday?

The question caught his throat
Grateful many more steps
Still to take before an answer

Todd led the exhausted group 
Up the hills towards his home 

Ben had not said a word
This group kept silence naturally

If the death of Ben's dad
Was related to yesterday's jail-break

It would soon be known 
 
Would his life likewise be shattered
That horizon
Closer with each step & familiar-landmark

A synchronized group says less & does more

Silence lightens the load with comtemplation
Silent interactions the substance of their communication 

The deep sleep of last night swept away traceless 

Now only the entreched feeling of a labor with no timely solution
Now only the acceptance of pain as a-state-of-being

The five miles drew two hours time
Under sun over cloudless sky
_

Seagulls squaked at them 
Enjoy'n the uncomfortable position
Of beings the gulls envied

Tables had turned to the birds favor
What is toilsome for humans is a lesiure birds

The world continued careless inside cars disconnected from their temporary coordinates
Distracted by the thought of the destination 

Four souls suffering & unable to begin to voice the matters-at-hand
Their souls at full-capacity with the present journey
_

Miss broke the silence 
'My name is Miss
'We have not formly met

The others didn't respond

'But I already know yours
'No need to introduce again
'Tho it would be polite

The communication took time to digest
After the miles & silence of misery
They just continued dumbly

Miss paitently continued
'I have been attached by operation  
'To this female Jewels who was offered
'As sacrifice to the diety Dagon

'To introduce him to the unanointed
'Is a oath-breaking death-sentence

'But I have the favor of the Seer
'So I may do as I please keeping oathsworn

'Dagon is a cosmic god
'Infathomable & Unsaitable

'Earth is bribed to Dagon 
'As an occult offer'n by those of the

'Esoteric Order of Dagon

'A sacrifice of this world
'& All worlds connected by Quantum-Entanglement

'For the bounty
'Past imaginations gods bestow


'All Earth will be consumed
'Drained dry as Mars

'Great powers lie in the foundations of this cult
'The blessings of omnipotent-powers-uncalculable 

'Some envision the gift of infinite-life
'Indesuptably to be as god themself

'I am one of those in faith of Dagon
'All worth in exchange for a god's blessing

'Jewels is the daughter of a wealthy family

'To pay the price of a family to join 
'The prime of their seed must be exchanged

'I am 400 years old
'The symbiotic member of this girl

'As payment into the order 
'The past must live as youth

'Don't be fooled 
'I offer much

'I heal her & repair her
'Myself surgeon centries-in-experience

'I guarntee her life till old age as a promise

The mass of Miss moved 
Her an inner-fleshly-lump in a manmade-skull the size of a small-ball 
The ball free to move to diffferent parts of Jewels body 

The right shoulder is her perch 
She talks there with the baby-arms holding the umbrella

'We worship the bowels of Dagon

'In Jewels was inserted divine-microbials
'This the digestion of the gods

'When I was an old woman we found the asteroid

'Tales of Eastern-Monks who under-tourture
'Guided us to prophetized mountain-village

'Prophecy built on ancient astrology 
'& deep-comsic-mathematics

'Decades after mining to the asteroid
'Lead to unprecedented discovery

'The asteroid contained mavervelous gifts 
'The Mound-of-Excrement of Dagon 
'Holy-be-it-Enternally

'Sadly only this small mass of what you see was left
'When the bateria-microbials were adjusted to our needs 

'These microbrial bacteria enhance the host completly 
'Bacteria that worship the well-being of the host as life-itself

'Jewels is stronger than all of you combined
'No more need for blood 
'Microbials refine all ingestion 

'I myself was the first generation to live with prepared hosts
'Viceroy Countess Miss of the Prime Circle - priestess of the many

'If that name doesn't get you out of a pinch
'Then Imma whores-wet-nurse

They kept to the sidewalks with the most shade & least people
The day was hella-hot & the boys burned pink

'I would proclaim Jewels owes us much 
'But she is a foolish girl gets youthful emotions 

'Yes Jewels is foolish
'Myself always busy 
'Patch'n up what she self inflicts

! WACK

Jewels lightly back-handed Miss

!PFT

Miss mumbled sorrowfully quiet for a time
'Well-I-never-I-my-life

But after a few blocks
Miss regained her full-compsure

'Tho 
'I am sympathtic 

'To her need to be kept from our modular fashions

'The inner courts ordered her to be pieced
'Into a more streamlined-being

'The operation was for this morn 

'Jewels is held by us as a priestess
'Name annointed Jewels by the Seer 
'Who fated her to rise above the most high

'The freckles on her body are themself maps to constellations
'The coordinates of a universe that attracts the best quantum-possibilites in all situations

'The Order will seek her out because she is this map 
'This flesh even after it is skinned will leads us to that universe 

'Only by the boon of Dagon
'After this world is consumed 

'Is it possible to fulfill the godsent-command
'To arrive in a Space-Of-Best-Blessings

'The freckles ever-changing as echoes to quantum existence 
'Understand this - her future has such consequence
'Her death would mean the end of this most-unique possibility

'Only one of our Entangeled-Possibilities needs to reach this destination
'Fate the power which will drag all divergencies into that perfect trajectory

'Miss has been entrusted
'Myself her humble lord

Miss stayed herself a while for Jewels to regain strength
It was not easy for Miss to talk while Jewels walked 

'The Esoteric Order of Dagon 
'Dates to mankinds earliest history 

'Trends have taken its symbolism to idolitary 
'Fools will be fools

'The Image of the lord Dagon is alone necessary to wield unobstructed power 
'Molecules themself bow to will exerted in presence of that Image

'I myself am a prophetess ordained by the Seer
'The Seer secretly entitled me to follow paths as Jewels wished

'But even the force of the whole-cult was too much to stop

'The thunder of your friend woke us 
'Providence appeared you before us 
'To show us out of an unbreachable-system 

'Knights & heroes pale to the deeds 
'Which you have yesterday all fulfilled

'It only at the cost
'Of only half a tongue

Miss proclaimed as if that a blessing
Miss was odd company to have 
The only thing pleasant
On the long stretch to Todd's house
