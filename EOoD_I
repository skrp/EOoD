###### ESOTERIC ORDER of DAGON

! Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers lining empty-halls

15 Minutes past the Bell
Point-of-no-return to class

Any student this late gets writ-up
Ironically worse than not-arriving-to-class-at-all

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail

His purpose in the basement
Below, front the door he planned to open 

Latency became mounted by endless-anticipation
Energy from day-dreaming now a hurdle
Aun compelled him towards the opposite direction

The thump of Todd's feet steady
Step-after-step up stairs to higher floors

A peace appreciated
In a place only-ever bustling

The few rays of the sun bore thru
Only to expose dust-polluted air
_

Mellow ambience shattered
Patters of running-feet charged towards his direction
From around the corner

Fortune placed Todd directly opposite the girls restroom

Distance leapt in one bound
He rushed to the last stall

Todd let out a cocky smirk
An instictual-ingenuity to hide in the girls

!! KAK

The cracked-seat broke plunging his left-foot ankle-deep into hour-old piss & shit

The door quietly opened
Someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled-yell came from the hallway
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

!! BOOM

Heavy-legs-kicked-open-near-cracked-the-door-in-half

That unexpected fright broke unprecedented-pressure into full-release

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSS
!!! PPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP
!!! PPPPPLLLLQQQQQQIIIPPPLLLUUUUKKKKIII

The entire school vibrated
Eruptions of great-masses expounded essays

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN
!!! YOU SHOULDA SAID WHY
!!! YOU NEEDED tHe gah hiRls

A schoolhall-monitor hooted out for-the-entire-building-to-know
Announcement gagged-quiet
Gas particles bloomed-out in a thick cloud
_

Room silent after the door fell shut & resettled
All walls of the building rumbled again
This time in unanimous giggles

!! PAT
!! PAT
!! PAT

Ben kicked at the stall door braced-shut by legs
'Gonna make your fat-cunt-trap
'Eat that shit you scabby-bitch

Todd stepped out of the stall
'Back off

Ben turned to him more crazed

! YOU

Todd swiftly tackled to the wall
Slamming hard as his soaked-foot slipped-out

Ben muffled as he struggled out his revenge
'You are the reason I got chased

'walk'n around
'like you weren't 
'skipping class

'a teacher notified
'the monitors and got me chased down

Todd maneuvered using Ben's force against him
Set forearms placed Ben in a locked-hold

After several curses & a long pause Ben surrendered
'Alright asshole
'You made your point

Todd pushed Ben off to a safe distance
A toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that
Jordan blushed-out the awkward introduction
'Im sick

He scruffed his unkept thick brown hair into a fluff
His subconcious mechanism to divert attention

For a while they were content with breathing the compressed-gas in silence
_

Walls washed white layer-after-layer
Extenuated by dark recesses between the tiles
Unable to conceal deep-red marked graffiti symbols

Piss marked all to a feminine territory
If only the stain but mostly the smell

Curiosity here only met horrors
All repelled from investigations

Ben broke the silence
'This place is kinda creepy

Hot-box-gassed-up
No where to go until the class period ended

A sound tickled Todd's ear
An enchanting burr at the tail-ends of the echoes

Before he realized he was interested
Echoes drew him closer to the wall

Todd was startled then reaffirmed

'There is a hum
'That sounds like a whimper
'Can you hear it

Jordan put in as he neared
'Probably a god-damned-ghost

He yelled at the trash-can playfully
'School is hella-haunted
'sk-a-dick Bettsy burns-the-dick

'back in the 50s ...
Jordan started his story

The hum came from the metal-box next to the trashcan
Rust smeared as Todd opened the lid for better acoustics
Vent dropped to darkness

Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

( need help help please help )

The sound came softened from great distance
But with a fullness-of-scream that rips apart throat-lining

The communication faint
Todd looked to the others for confirmation

( help us    please )

Jordan ventured between Todd & at the vent
'Here
'we are here

'Where are you

( can you hear me  hello please help )

Jordan continued
'We hear you
'We will get the Principal

!!! nnnneeeeeeehhhhhhoooooooooooo

The shriek took all three back in a tight terror
Pitch-to-curl-ear-hairs in absolute revolution

Todd opened the lid with both his hands to shout down

'Who ever you are
'Where ever you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately
The others followed dazed

To them it seemed
A reckless commitment

At 10-min-to-the-bell the hall is at its most empty
Policy prohibits anyone out-in-the-hall

The trio made their way without obstruction
All Monitors would be back in their lounge on the couch

Todd led them confidently down lower floors

'I discovered a secret passage behind a door
'When I got lost my first-year fire-drill

'All year I been trying to work myself
'Up to this before graduation

'No chance ever came
'So today I promised
'I would make it happen

Todd was the only-one-he-knew who had seen that long-corridor
Despite years he still believed in what he had seen

'Since first-year
'I been planning how explore it

'Today is too much for coincidence
'That door will lead us to her
'I am certain

Todd now empowered by rambunctious company
Three boys followed the stairwells down
A small pack not-to-be-fucked-with

On-the-move breaking all violations
They were all-in since they left the girls

Todd continued as they rossed lengths of halls of the first year students
'When I got lost

'I felt someone calling out to me by-name
'I followed
'Tho less-than-a-handful knew my name

'I found a door at the end of the hall
'It was unlocked
'At first I only peaked in out of curiosity
'The schools reputation for strange drew me in to find a story of my own

Jordan jumped in
'Trust me you dont know most of it
'There was this one story 

Todd annoyed kept on his same train of thought
'But at the back of the closet
'There was a light-source instead of shadow

Jordan perked in interest
He let Todd continue without offense

'I had time to wander so I entered
'I discovered a long corridor

'The path went ahead for a long time
'It ended at a black hole in a wall

'I am sure it leads down
'But I forced myself to go back
'Before I got near enough to know

'Goddam-creepy-place

Todd looked ahead determined
Pent-up-forces now unleashed propelled him forward unstoppable

Thru the hall towards the basement
Moving around windows
One-at-a-time ninja-like iill they got near gym-lockers

Jordan expounded
Stirred with the brisk walk

'Shit-man
'Most my papers for school
'Were all about school history
'Lame-as-fk-mate 

'Yo tho 
'One caught me like

!daymn

'At center-city-library
'People all WTF
'You shoulda been there it was classic

'But the article caught me unexpected
'Bored, but try'n to look like
'I wasn't only there for the roof

'Im thumb'n thru all these papers from the start
'Research'n the first instance Driscol got famous

'This floor is the only basement
'Right so with that-in-mind

'There was one article
'blow-your-mind-man

'A boy found pieced-up
'In a fishy cult ritual

'Im like some lil muthrfkr
'Put this pulp in tryna-act-smart

'But !Daymn
'The newspaper was solid-legit

'The article said the janitor
'Alerted authorities from across the county
'They almost hung-up on him as nutt-case

'But then they heard him
'Get eaten da-fk alive
'Fleshy sounds & munching
'Huge masses of people chanting

'Man screaming 
'Kept alive past possible

'PoPo from all over the county stormed the place

'That shit all happened 
'according to multiple statements in the newspaper
'On the muthrfkn-second-basement floor

'First I took it considered Uni Hospital first-floor
'But then I remember from a previous research paper 
'This building only had two floors 
'Over ten years later the Uni was built over the school

'I tried to correspond
'But nah nothing man

'We are talking total-silence as in
'Newspapers from that entire month
'All gone missing

'She-it-son 
'That archive was a national data-bank

'Only the physical copy I was holding
'So I stole that shit & now its framed
'One day might be worth fat-wads
_

Each panting hard after traverseing three-floors
Neverousness strained fibers of the soul

Driscol the school with the worlds highest-abduction statistics
Prisions were less locked-down than the students of this school

Ben countered at the steamroll-logic
'I been here all 3 years 

'If there were multi-basement-levels
'There would be some proof

'A reworked stairwell
'Modified to only move up

'I been on both sides
'Of the main Wells

'Those walls are as old as Miss Finely

Jordan added revrently 
'may-the-cunt-bitch-rest-in-peices

Ben kept speaking
'There would be structural-columns
'With three basements those pillars
'Cant just be erased off the structure

'fk-more-so
'All first-floor classroom-ceilings are mangled-patchwork
'From the Uni construction

Ben accentuated with a pointed finger
'The Uni had way more money & that job still trash

'You both believe that a stairwell could just disappear
'These stairwells were created by god on the 8th-day for fks-sake
_

A closet door tucked to the exterior-wall at the far-end 
At the end of the classrooms as to isolate it an alone door

Todd approached the door window
All transpired as domino-effect of past choices

Small window exposed a narrow janitor closet
Todd's sweaty palms slid on the locked knob

The light was still on
Back of the closet exposed a definite century-old-wall

Despite countless proofs human-heart only ever ready to doubt
To confirm all else besides what his experience told him
All momentum fell flat on its face as mis-step 

'got-it
Jordan knelt in front and took off his pack
Retrieved a pouch, door open, & pack back on Jordan's back
Before the other two could follow the action

Once inside, after the brooms & mops to hid inside
The hallways were always stressful places
Any moment an unfortuante passing would get them found-out

Jordan was not dismayed by Todd forelorn face of loss
After two quick movements the back wall of the closet fell inwards

A corridor was revealed to turn down a very-long-hallway
_

The narrow corridor followed the exterior wall
Single-file on eerie currents of certain course 
Irreversible alterations defined life
Endorphins flowed in bounty of oft-asked-questions

Ben admitted
'This is the real outer wall

'I always thought it was odd
'There were no small windows
'In any of the rooms in the basement


'The Fire Marshall
'Got the school on fire-code

'Rather than expose this wall
'They built that new northside-stairwell
'Whole week the Firemen escorted people up to the hospital
_

The walls made of pilgrim-brick
Large, thick & dark-purple

Brickwork lost technique now rare
Yet still seen on happenstance 

Most of the bricks stolen & sold-off
They marveled surrounded by an infinite amount 

Tunnel was bare yet with purpose
No back doors to any classrooms

Only to continue long-passage after long-passage
A solid purple tunnel confirmed both security & a cage
_

The end came up abruptly as a blank wall

Todd went busily to search for the door from his memory

Ben chirpped
'The architect must have been a comedian

Jordan countered
'Or hide access
'To an entire level in a closet

'Pilgrims times
'The bay was too huge to defend

'Before all them well-to-do-fk-you-fucks
'Bought up all bayside lands

'Back in that day
'This was a scary place to live
'Everyone with guns & knives
'Sure-as-shit-sticks 

'Pirates raided every year
'Roy Miller Path
'Arcs right with this school at its head
'As far as any raider ever went
'Often to kidnapped kids

'Thats why we have that motto

'Once a Buc
'Always a Fk

Ben thought he knew school history
He only vaguely heard people talk of what Jordan said

Ben noticed on the old bricks
Symbols carved in peculiar diagrams
The sprawl of it was typical of angry graffiti

Todd had been busy searching for the door he now only-remembered

Todd's nails scraped against the wall
Along a fine-line found only after difficulty

Jordan moved him out of the way to work at it with a thin steel bar

Ben jolted
'How do you manage to get that thru entry-clearance

Jordan's eyes lit in a smirk
He put he bar to Ben's face to inspect the lines & numbers

Ben replied only half convinced
'Security really believes you use that as a ruler

Jordan laughed
'Its more believable in its bag next to my pencils & calculators

Peeled-paint revealed a metal door
2ft above-the-ground 3ft high-and-wide

Jordan turned to them for-real
'She-it
'We get caught back here
'Gonna be us screaming

'Think some rag-hoe
'Next period hearing our screams
'Gonna do the same for us

'Best-recognize

'Might as well go all-in
'Right from the start

Jordan patted his bar on palm confidently

Todd took the bar from Jordan
'Maybe I should hold onto that

Jordan only looked at his hands
He felt betrayed by them 
So swift & sure Todd's action

Jordan raised an eyebrow
Content to let Todd do the rest of the work

They all helped pry the hinges into creaked-submission

Somehow Todd always knew this went down
Now he saw into the black depths

The door had the lock from the inside
It fell down the shaft in distant bangs for a long, long time

Jordan let out
'Pilgrims were paranoid muthrfkrs

Ben looked at Jordan
'Wouldn't you be

Jordan smirked back
'be? 

'Son Im worse
'My locks may bend
'But they never break

Ben didn't know how to place that remark
Unsure if Jordan was full of the shit his slang promised
_

Dark musty air flowed immediately to them & up
Strong-as-a-gulf-breeze
Hot as furnace vent

Something caught Todd's eye
He poked at it with the bar

Elevator-cords hung in the mid hidden by darkness

'If there are 3 basements
'Then there are only two floors to explore

An exchange of glances agreed compliance

Jordan looked casual
Ben looked like he would not back down

Todd reached with extended-arm and grasped the cord
'Reach out with both hands
'& Commit

He let himself be drawn into the darkness
He left them with a confident smirk
He was prepared for this

Todd fell to the deep
In an unstoppable rapid-slide

!!! HAILMARYFULLOFGRACE
_

All was dark
Distance only abstract 

Movement only testified by the-burning-of-his-palms
Sweat-sprung as will-fought-for-life

To grasp a frictionless cord as skin yeilded to muscles

Todd ventured his legs out
He managed to stop himself into near splits

'Thank-the-Father
He did morning-prayers today

!!! TODD
The other two screamed frantically down

Todd looked up
The door only a small smudge of silver
In the infinity of dark space


'Im okay
'Im okay

'There is oil on the cords
'I should have expected it

'Gonna take off my shirt
'Use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

Ben asked automatically
Without idea on how to back up the offer
'Do you need help up

Todd fearless began to climb at a controlled rate
'Its best only one person
'Be on the cord at the same time

'Im gonna try
'To find a door
'To get to one of the floors
'I fell pretty far
'So Im guess'n up

Skin-peel-palms grateful-past-pain
For the cool protection of the shirt
_

Todd didn't notice any doors in the commotion down

The best course would be to climb up slowly
To ensure he could get back up

He would feel for the door with this feet
He spat out iron-tainted saliva
'Old oil

The slide down had cleared off most of the oil
His covered-hands now had clean purchase

Only sounds of his labored breath & swell-of-air

The gusts came intense, rising in heat from deep-darkness

Todd felt a gust on his stomach
It was cool & didn't come from below
He stomped out the outline of the door

! TWANG
! TWANG

A beam bore into the darkness

'I think

! I found it

With one hand he felt for a handle
The door was there, he could feel the cold metal

!! POMP
!! POMP

Todd stomped the corner down
He pulled himself higher
Kicking-down until the door gave way

He pulled himself into the dusty grey hallway
At the end of a long corridor

'Im off the cords
'Come down

'Wrap your shirt around your hands
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Jordan challenged
'Best just stay back
'Something get loose and fall
'Right into your face

Ben & Jordan followed down & swiftly entered

Ben, last, climbed inside scraping his knee
Looking up saw Todd & shrieked back falling-on-his-ass

! FUCK

Todd was covered in dusk-caked dark-blood-mud
Blood not oil had been on the cords

Smears were left where Todd had touched himself
Jordan hadn't taken much notice of it

The silver of the dust seemed to repeat what available light there was
_

Forward in a cautious manner of adventure
Level an abandoned fully-equipped-hospital 
All lay as if it had been unexpectedly sealed off

Electricity still flowed on this floor
Emergency-signs gave enough light for them to move secure

Jordan spoke in a whisper
'move & stay
'think first

Jordan in front with hand up for them to stop
He crouched down & motioned the other two low

'look at the ground
'any movement is timestamped & each direction obvious

Both caught in admiration of their newfound companion
Jordan broght them to a crossroads of halls next to a room

'look close at each hall & the room
His finger traced out-lines of different levels of dust layers
Careful to keep to his rule to not make extraneous movements

'I cant tell the exact days
'Only the relative difference in traffic 

'this is the main hall
'the path has thinned down 
'compared to the hall there we came from

'compare it to inside the room
'there no traffic goes into it

'this is how we can know where to go

The room had an overturnt bed with a familiar form half sprawled
Ben entered to drawn down a corner of dust-layered blanket

A husked-corpse exposed what left of its face
Sweet smells stung their noses

! twang
Ben recoiled back flipping a metalic bedpan
Urine long-since dried-up & fecal matter dust

All froze to the simple horror 
Death the expectation of failure

Ben's face captured shame & apology

! bap
! bap bap

Main hall echoed meaty wacks
Each nearly shit-themselves

! aaaahhrrrrr
! eeekkkaahhggggggggggggg

The distant defiant cry gurggled into silence
Jordan herded them into the room
Each took a corner of the blanket they lifted 
Thick-settled-dust of the blanket flung over their tracks partially-covering the treads from the shaft
_

Boys huddled in the room
Corpse for company
Green of the blanket still stained silver by the dust
Respectfully laid back over the dead-body

The day had long-since numbed their nostrils
Sweet-smell now lost to their senses

After time passed Todd braved a whisper of a thoughts which nagged him
'The shaft went past the length two floors
A question which none could answer

'Uni dumps the body-parts thru it to where?
'Any well would fill up eventually

'That explanation doesnt make much sense

Jordan spoke 
'Not much sense
'To have a hospital as a secret basement

'A-mid-evil sex-dungeon
'where-bad-kids-get-krumpus

'that would ease my sanity

'This obviously abandoned
'While in full-service

Todd whispered
'Doesnt make sense
'Water from the tap
'Electricity

! snap
Ben lurched at the obvious fact he overlooked
He took off his pack & repursposed the blanket as tent

Plugged into power
Plugged into network

Jordan & Todd both third-wheel
Put on edge by Ben's rapid-fire-keystrokes

Risk-of-them-all-weighed-in-&-merited
Curse-the-free-will-of-others

The corpse stared back at them
Hair over-grown long as womans but its sex lost to time
Its jaw dangled stoopidly
Its hollow eyes held a truth
Mystery to present company

Someone was trapped & beaten in the concealed sub-basement of the school
The authorities would no-doubt do likewise to the trio of boys

The three huddled in a room on an abandoned-level layers from escape

An elevator shaft the only known exit

Jordan an expert in these situations

Mousecraft
The sure way to go about these things

Patience & long-waiting
Until absolute vacancy was established

Period-bells could still be faintly-heard
They waited for an entire period

Silence a time for meditation
Accept this drastic turn of Friday morn

Ready to decide upon actions with dire-consequences
_

Eyes & senses well-accustomed they proceeded to the main hall

Halls mirrored the  logical-structure of school above
Main hall circled, outside & inner, arrays-of-rooms

All watched for signs of frequented areas 
Fresh-signs of treads not-man-made but out-of-mind for later digestion

Jordan led them to a path that was taken daily

One head-of-the-path led to a stairwell
They followed the other head towards a double-doored-room

Path to the entrance was fresh
Todd & Ben hung back as Jordan looked thru a crack
Confirming no movement he motioned the others to follow

Stairs descended into a deep arena
Workstations arrayed each segment of stratus

Industrial-lamps draped over each stone table
Shiny-rungs glinted embedded as obvious restraint ports

Under each table
Various shelves for various instruments

Jordan's heart fainted
'All the tools
'In all these stations
'Down all the rows
'Polished-from-recent-use

Fresh path led to a table at center-stage
The only table with its light on

A nude-red-headed-girl bound illuminated
Strapped to the table by a broad-leather-belt

So bruised was her face
Impossible to see her freckles

Freckles covered her entire body
Freckled to the point 
Tho bloody, bruised & nude
Freckles the first characteristic noticed
Infinite constellations of cherry-colored-dots

Stitch-patch-closures covered her torso 
Patches appeared in similar fashion all over her body

Her shut-eyes sprang into maniacal-alertness
Two large yellow-orbs in fierce fire

Three boys, not monsters, stood over her

Jordan immediately busy but unable to free any strap
'How do we get these loose

After no response yet exhausted of ideas
Confused past-exasperated he spoke to her square-on
'How
!daFKget
'These god-damn-straps-off

Entirely realizing how idiotically loud he was
Boys behind him idle & timid to horror intertwined with hormones

The girl screamed earlier
Now she won't speak to save her ass & theirs

She opened her mouth in wide-display
A mutilated-stump-of-a-tongue-in-a-wag

Stump freshly seared & gleamed with an odd-gooish-sealant

A small muffled voice came to fullness
'Finally sorry
'I could not speak

'Hardly-breathe
'When she lays like that

The voice became more clear yet kept small

! Jewels
'Dont move like that neanderthal
'I need to get ready to introduce us

'A hundred years will teach you patience bitch
'You think I dont know what you are doing

Infantile hands forced its way out of a tangle of hair
A creature emerged from her shoulder

A shrunken-head
Two baby-arms attached under shriveled-ears
_

The trio looked aghast
A monster perched on the girl's shoulder

'Yes this is a shock
'I understand ignorance
The little head replied indignant

Jewels cast her face-to-the-side-ashamed
Nude & openly disfigured took over her predicament as most-painful

The little head made a-small-exasperated-sound
'How are you such a bitch all the time
'You expect these twirps to keep their shit
'With you crying about yours

! hhhmmmmp

'I can find you a new-tongue
'A longer one if you are into-that

'You had much worse
'Now no need to disrespect me

'Miss the Countess
Her hands gestured a bow & the little head tilted

~for-fks-sake
Jordan leant in between the two
! we-gotta-get-the-fk-outta-here

'The bands are one leather belt
The creature paused dancing a rod idly in the air
'Hurry up
'There is not a second to spare

'Above our head you can release it
'Come on rodents
'Not a moment to lose 

'Jewels can't speak now
'& I can't read her mind
'But I can sense what she is feeling

'She feels ashamed of me right now
The puppeted-head trailed on

Jordan found the clasp to be odd-shaped
Only after ingenuity was the leather-band released
Only with the help of the metal bar & 6 arms

Jordan's shirt was the least dirty
Jewels wore it as a small dress

Miss had them make a measurement & a cut
Foremost was to tailor the shirt for her-form

The demeanor of Miss had an instant way to blind the truth
Interacting with her as to-an-adult

Ben's shoes didn't fit Jewels only his socks

Miss rapped Ben as he knelt to re-lace the shoes
The rod extended to a painful twang that resonated in his skull

'We need to hurry
'If they come back soon
'Each one of us will be strapped again
'All the worse for let

Promptly they made exodus out that devilish auditorium

The light had a cruel elderly-tint-of-aged-desperation
Its rays seemed to follow them in a-haunting-fashion as-if-pointing-direction
Vengeful that what themselves had accepted must be fated-true unto-all
_

The elevator cord now clean enough to allow them quick-access back up to the basement

Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their predicament

Todd smeared all over in blood
Thin-streams ran down his face like bloody-tears
Jordan was shirtless
His odd-shaped-belly buldged-out
All were caked in dust
And finally there was Jewels

Ben admitted despair
'How the fk are we going to get out of school
'They are going to know where we have been immediately

'Put us back down here at all costs

Jordan wailed back
'Fk they will just say
'It was another god-damn-drill

'Shit happens like every couple months

'I have a plan
Todd opened the closet door & walked into the school hall

Dusty
Shirtless
Pantless
Bloody

They broke into the hall cast from horror
Sharply outlined to a monotony-of-normal-scenes
The view more contrast by their outlandish forms

Todd had a pre-planned route of exit

At the end of the hall a teacher stopped her lecture
She opened the door and yelled

!!! MONITOR
!!! MONITOR SECTION 7

!!! 459

The call for any who heard to plaster against hall-windows
A mosh-pit of greedy-kids starved for 1st-hand-account 
Only a limited section for viewing

Marinated in day-dreams from revels of the earlier shit-show

Several girls touted the hideous state of the infamous toliet
Some kid Ben had obliterated 

The main attraction like a relic in a church
Girls would recount their impression always to curious gatherings of students

Up on lunch-meal-meds now in a riot
Each young-heart feral

The four phantasms spectated only by larger-classmates
Teachers in this way were barred from executing proper protocol 
_

Todd led them around the corner to rush up the stairwell

Two large Monitors stood as sentinels
Locked-down-in-protocol at the-main-exit

!!! MONITORS
!!! SECTION 1

!!! 459

Two voices boomed

Todd already passed the hall turnt leading them across the level to stairwells
Movement looked like Todd's plan failed to the other four

Yet the aura told a confidence that the others relied on whole-heartily 

There was no time to explain
Only for Todd to choose and the rest to follow
_

Cross the school in this method
All Monitors would be drawn to the wrong location

Their exit was higher-up school-levels
Not at the ground-floor as expected
_

Every window filled
Every door blocked

Curious-children stirred by shouts
Starved-sights of spectation
Charged by an eventful-day

Teachers more scared of the fight-pits
Than to do their duty

This factor allowed the five
To the second-floor unhindered
_

Jordan pulled out his metal-bar
'Now is the reckoning
'Suggest yall wake-up likewise

Ben had a second-purpose for his laptop-computer & cords
All his files were stored on a USB drive

They passed the restroom of the morn
Towards the end of the hall

Todd took out a key from his pocket
He unlocked the window

'Just do what I do
'Go where I go

They climbed out onto a narrow ledge
The sun shone hotly on them
They burned under it with exhaustion

Four-odd-bodies outside on the second-story
World outside too-busy-with-the-day to notice

The ledge continued to an adjacent roof
They crossed over to a high-branched tree

The branch overhung onto the roof in an entangled attachment

By that means they climbed down to ground-level
At the back of the school

Onward into alleys towards less-traveled roads

Each of the boys knew how to pass-this-area without-being-seen
They ran tired but now they knew this-stage was their-turf

They knew over what fences led where
Up which buildings to what

Rat-true
Now they could not get caught

Jewels only had a large shirt & Ben's sweaty socks
Ben carried her piggy back the intervals he could

Headed by Jordan, the other two at her side
This kept her mostly covered

Large-city-bustlers continued their way without heed
The four moved as a pack following Jordan's lead
_

They arrived at the edge of Downtown
Outskirts to the industrial-sector

Jordan turned them into an alley
& Thru a hole in a chain-linked-fence he loosed then bound back

They quickly entered thru a locked-window
The edifice as dusty as the sub-basement

They cautiously followed Jordan's movements

Hopping from board-to-board
Their trace with few tracks
Up the stairs to a room

Office building once had been a newspaper printery
Newspapers stacked in dusty heaped still bound together

Jordan locked the room with a chain after they entered
He then pushed away a cabinet to reveal another chain-locked door

'This far from anyone
'Gotta be triple-sure
'So as to sleep

'Breakin thru one of these
'Loud enough to wake whatever sleep

An outside window exposed the endless ocean
Dust free & ocean breeze

Jordan led them thru the outside window
To a fire-escape covered by patched-tarps

The floor was of netted-metal
An escaped rope tied on one end was coiled to a corner
'Got a tank of rain water
Jordan pointed up

'Open the spout
'& Close it with this knob

Jordan motioned them to turn around

'Aint clear-water
'But cleaner than you

He took a brisk wash in water heated-by-the-sun
The water splashed far below

Jewels & Miss to theirself
Front the window content with the bayside view

Endless ocean to the right
Left held the iconic skyline

Fresh air taken into grateful lungs
Peace long-lost now found in abundance
_

While waiting for Todd to finish
Ben asked Jordan
'So what is this place

He laid on the stitched-cardboard-mat 

Jordan looked-down as his face blushed
'This is one of the places I live
_

Refreshed & completely exhausted

All laid on layers of cardboard-stitched japanese-tatami

Ocean gusts massaged their tense skin
All slept passed-out-till-next-morn

In safe slumbers
Soothed by the-sound-of-steady-waves
_

They all woke in the daze of a new life
Jordan fed them dried fruit & granola
Washed down with Mtn-Dew

'Got locations like this
'City wide

'I can go any where
'And find myself alright in an hour

'Tho this one is the nicest
'Each has a stash of all I need

Jordan closed the container & stashed the food-box in the closet

'Last week I was stuck across town
'The food there must have went bad
'I was so exhausted I cant remember eating

Jordan finished looking apologetically at Ben
All that now mostly forgotten by the day

!fk

Ben realized his predicament with this father
His father would be ready with a self-righteous beating

It was Saturday-morn
From Friday-morn to now the trance finally woken

Jordan had a rummage-of-clothes raided from the downtown charity

Jewels was head-to-toe with garments that mostly fit
She had hiking-sandals with wool stockings
The light-blue summer-dress only-a-little-too-short

That morn her & Miss  tailored the outfit
Repurposed-stockings for her forearms

Jills was very sensitive about her arms

Miss always held a finely-made extendable-umbrella
This would bar anyone from seeing what was quick-to-hide

Jordan now wore a pocketed vest

Ben took an old-leather-jacket
He tied in a roll under his pack

Todd took a set of wool gloves for his hands
They were very raw after his recleaning this morn
_

Jordan trailed their exit
Covering their tracks as they returned to the streets

'Take everything
'I never go to the same place
'In the same week

Ben needed to get to the payphone at the lower-district Circle-K

The day was warming to be hot

The heat relaxed overworked-muscles
Warmed after a prolonged-stiff-sleep

Ben looked at Todd
'We only have enough for one call
'You mind if I use it

Todd complied
'I am the last of our litter
'My parents wouldn't know if I was gone for a week

The pressing pace of life left Jewels & Miss still to be sorted out
_

After 4 rings
Ben tried the oldman next-door

The old voice responded
'Heeh Hello

'Mr. Grinvix this is Ben
There was no response for some time

'I just wanted to call to ask if you see my dad
'Tell him I'm on my way home

There was only silence
'He isn't answer'n the phone

Ben waited awkwardly
Only the sound of heavy breath'n

The old man finally spoke
'Your dad
'is dead boy

'You best get to the authorities
'an have 'em tell ya

The voice was sympathetic but immediately hung up

Ben stood silent leaving the phone to his ear
Flabbergasted from truth-revealed-lie

His dad would always be there

A jackass who tried hard to keep a light heart

To never-again hit him
Nor give him advice-no-other-could

A man regretful of being a father stuck with a son

Man enough to power thru that hardship
That too-often-than-not himself the cause

Ben physically-worked to come-to-grips
Understandings toppled down
Dazed among rubble

The four in silence
Left him space to wail
_

!!! PLUUPP
!!! PLUPPP

A police car had silently snuck up behind the crew
Its lights now bright at their backs

'Alright you juuhhhh

The cop cut short as the pack immediately bolted

He turned & fumbled open the door
Which he preemptively shut

Today was not a mood for the cop
'Im gonna bust diaphrams
'fkn-lil-shit-fks

The officer called into his shoulder-piece
'Broc here
'I got a 281 on that 459
'Update the 459 is now a 499

Cop reversed sirens blaring
Actuator of the law of this land

Empowered by the level 9 code
Perpetrators better dead

Focus-as-predator never dropping target
In that negligence he was fused into the building Circle-K

An overworked-trucker backed by near a ton of Coca-Colas
The impact shifted both forces into the path of the store
An unstoppable mountain till the back wall 

Flesh crunched in sharp folds of metal
Dorito-chips soaked soggy as in salsa

Cop drowned to a cold-death of Mtn-Dew-Slurpee
_

Todd looked back in relief

Police must have been the result of Ben calling his neighbor
The timing on the cop made sense if dispatched from Downtown-Station

He pathed the pack the back way uptown
The city knew their identities & placed to ambush them

Questions caught his throat
Grateful of the many more steps still to take before an answer

Todd led the exhausted group up the hills towards his home 

Ben had not said a word
The group kept silence 

If the death of Ben's dad was related to yesterday
It would soon be known 

That horizon closer with each step & familiar-landmark
Silence prepares the way with comtemplation

The deep sleep of last night swept away traceless 

Now only entreched in labor with no timely solution
Now only the acceptance of pain as the-state-of-being

The five-miles drew two-hours time
Under sun unabated over a cloudless sky

Seagulls squaked 
Enjoyment of the uncomfortable position of beings the gulls envied

Tables now turned to the birds favor
What is toilsome for humans a lesiure birds

The world continued careless
Inside cars disconnected from their momentary-coordinates
Distracted by the thought of the destination 

Five souls suffering & unable to begin to voice the matters-at-hand
At full-capacity with present journey
Up hills looming over the Downtown bay
Favoring sidewalks with more shade

A once normal world betrayed as an alien-state
To a group so fused in the throes of turmoil
_

Miss broke the silence 
'I am Miss
'We have not formly met

'I already know your names
'No need to introduce again
'Tho it would be polite

The communication took time to digest
After the miles & silence of misery
They just continued dumbly

Miss paitent
'I have been attached by operation  
'To this girl Jewels who was offered
'As sacrifice to Dagon

'To introduce Dagon to the unanointed
'Is an oath-breaking death-sentence

'But I have the favor of the Seer
'So I may do as I please keeping-oathsworn

On the shoulder of the a sidewalk-less street
The pack crossed to a side walk of an office-complex

Miss able to set down the umbrella to focus more of her energy on explainations
Sure of what were only questions to Todd
Only able to derail the sorrow for a short-time

'Dagon is a cosmic god
'Infathomable & Unsaitable

'Earth is bribed to Dagon 
'As an occult offer'n by those of the
'Esoteric Order of Dagon

'A sacrifice of this world
'& All worlds connected by Quantum-Entanglement
'For the bounty
'Past imaginations which gods bestow

'All Earth will be consumed
'Drained dry as Mars

'Great powers lie in this cult's foundations 
'The blessings of omnipotent-powers-uncalculable 

'Some envision the gift of infinite-life
'Indesuptably to be as god themself

'I am one of those in faith of Dagon
'All is worth in exchange for a god's blessing

'Jewels is the daughter of a wealthy family

'To pay the price of a family to join 
'The prime of their seed must be given 

'Truthful it is an honor not a curse

'I am 400 years old
'But only a year as symbiotic member of this girl

'As payment into the order 
'The past must live as youth

'Don't be fooled 
'I offer much

'I heal her & repair her
'Myself surgeon centries-in-experience

'I guarntee her life till old age & wise counsel

When Miss traveled to other parts of the body she burrowed
A fleshly-lump the size of a small-ball that moved under skin 

The right shoulder is her preferred perch 
She talks there with the baby-arms holding the umbrella
A shell that Miss tucks away into Jewels shoulder

'We worship the bowels of Dagon

'In Jewels was inserted divine-microbials
'This the digestion of the gods

'When I was an old woman we found the asteroid

'Tales of Eastern-Monks who under-tourture
'Guided us to a prophetized mountain-village

'Prophecy built on ancient astrology 
'& Deep-cosmic-mathematics could not compromise 

'Decades after mining to the asteroid
'Lead to unprecedented discoveries

'The asteroid contained mavervelous gifts 

'The Mound-of-Excrement of Dagon 
'Holy-be-it-Enternally

'Sadly only this small mass of me was left
'When the bateria-microbials were adjusted to our needs 

'These microbrial bacteria enhance the host 
'Bacteria sentient of the well-being of the host as life-itself

'Jewels is stronger than all you boys combined
'Microbials refine all ingestion & assimilation 

'I myself was the first generation to live with prepared hosts
'Viceroy Countess Miss of the Prime Circle 

'If that name doesn't get you out of a pinch
'At some future point when your life is on the line
'Then Imma whores-wet-nurse

They kept to the sidewalks with the most shade & least people
The day was hella-hot & the boys burned pink

Gusts would drown out her voice
Perked of interest they walked close together as Miss's voice did not carry

'I would proclaim 
'Jewels owes us much 

'But she is a foolish girl
'Gets youthful emotions 

'Yes Jewels is foolish
'Myself always busy 
'Patch'n up what she self-inflicts

! WACK
Jewels back-handed Miss

Miss mumbled sorrowfully quiet for a time
! PFT

'Well-I-never-in-my-life
~ hmp

After a few blocks
Miss regained her full-compsure

'Tho 
'I am sympathtic 

'To her need to be kept
'From our modular fashions

'The inner-circle ordered her to be pieced
'Into a more sensibly-modified-being

'The operation was for this morn 

'Jewels is held by us as a priestess
'Name annointed Jewels by the Seer 
'Who fated her to rise above the most high

'The freckles on her body
'Make-up a map to constellations

'The coordinates to a universe
'That attracts the best quantum-possibilites in all situations

'The Order will seek her out because she is this map 
'This skin even-as-leather will leads us to that universe 

'Freckled-patterns can not be captured 
'The freckles shift & move
'As if this location is transient
'Some sphere which settles in favorable situations

'A true Eden to rebirth our Quantum Entanglements

'Only by the boon of Dagon
'After this world is consumed 
'Is it possible to fulfill the godsent-command
'To arrive in a Space-Of-Best-Blessings

'Understand this 
'Her future has such consequence
'If her skin was lost to the Order
'It would mean the end of this most-unique possibility

'Powers like currents have drawn Jewels
'First to wealth, then to the Order
'Now away from the Order
'It is my suscpicion that many would rather guard leather
'Than this girl who has such free will

Jewels red hair caught the beams of sun
A royal beauty that no patchwork could mar
The strange girl who even now drew them together
Men would cat-call out to her & women would envy

Miss continued after they crossed the street
'Only one of our Entangeled-Possibilities needs to reach this destination
'Fate the power which will drag all divergencies to realigned perfect trajectory

'To trust in the power of Fate
'Future to have power to change the past

'The sacrifice of all
'As payment for all to attain
'A more perfect existence

'Our order alone
'Decides for all 
'In solemn manners

Commerical zones now faded to residential streets
Schools, graveyards & empty-lots

Miss stayed herself a while 
Jewels needed to regain strength
It was not easy for Miss to talk while Jewels walked 

'The Esoteric Order of Dagon 
'Dates to mankinds earliest history 

'Trends have taken its symbolism to idolitary 
'Fools will be pretensious 

'The Image of Dagon
'Alone necessary 
'To wield unobstructed power 

'Molecules bow to will
'Exerted in presence of that Image

'I myself am a prophetess ordained by the Seer
'The Seer secretly entitled me
'Follow paths by accordance to Jewels

'But the force of the whole-cult 
'Too much to stop

'Someone so imporant must be improved as insurance
'Every day new demands which I alone could not save her

'The thunder of your friend woke us 
'Providence gathered all that morn 
'To rescue us out of an unbreachable-system 

'Knights & heroes pale to the deeds 
'Which you have yesterday fulfilled

'It only at the cost
'Of only half a tongue

Miss proclaimed as if that a blessing
Miss was odd company to have 

The only thing pleasant
On the long stretch to Todd's house

Sun hot in the hours after noon
Lights were on in Todd's house

Todd burst inside heart-in-throat
Eyes readjusting to the different-light

The smell of the outside
Inside the house 

The windows were broken
Leaves whipped-up under family-portraits

Forms of countless-cats at once were made out infesting every shadow
Suddenly the felines sprang into a frenzy

A large Calaco immediately charged Todd 
The heft of it large-muscles-buldging-tense

Todd had two-smarts-on it
A kick & a snatch

Each of his siblings had owned a cat
He pwned these mangey-cunts

10 cats stopped the attack
None of them cared to risk the same demise of their leader

Act duplicated over & over 
Calaco a goolike-mash-upon-the-walls

Fresh pulp of meat arose any kitty salivate
So exquistely-rare the patee 
Despite quelled-up with great fear of the rampage 
Several stopped for a quick-lick

Felines swarmed over something on the maternal bed
Most of the body was chewed up but it was his mother

Todd began vomiting in the habitual direction of the restroom

Huched-face-first-ass-out across the toilet
Past-prime-pickings now only a gluttonous-feed
The mass of his father

Todd cleared out his home
Macabre painted in stern-rigtheousness 

The corpses of his parents foamed out of each mutilated orafice
Grey puss foamed over the lines of each scratch

No cat-claw could pierce Todd's thick wool-gloves
_

Neighbors came out to witness the loathesome scene
Guilty & in fear of the boy they all betrayed

None with courage to venture near
After witnessing the horrendous death of the twins
Two basketball-players on the way home decided to aid the shrieks
They returned to the streets puss-filled choked-dead mid-crawl

The police came but did not interfere
_

After the last of the cats, past tears 
Todd left the house bathed in warm guts 

Todd would use his might to bust the belly
Legs-to-legs above his head 

Cats in lunacy avoided the same fate
Busy in actions which often condemned them in irony

Thick wool golves perfect for pussy-busting
Raw flesh able to breathe
Yet protected from all-else
_

Cats have 9 lives
But they are their own-worst-enemy

Cats take too long to do anything 
Contemplating calculated actions aun to their demise

10s of bodies litered the rooms 

Jules could not walk fast in sandals
Jordan & Ben decided to give Todd his space

Near 100 disembowled-bodies trailed Todd's direction

Over short distance the cat is quick
Over long distance mankind reigns supreme

Aun to naps the cats put-off-guard 
Awoken too late by the scent of gore dripping off Todd 

Over-fence, thru-yard, along-country-road, over-cemeteries, thru-fields
Until finally rocky bays of ocean 

Rock-to-rock in hops 
Crashing waves below

Cats moved with agility 
But Todd still much faster

Todd climbed up birthed in gore 
Only one entry into a thicket-walled-island

The twisted narrow-tunnel opened up to a vast expanse 

Antiquated farm-equipment
Animals of a rare variety
Fire-pits with altars 

One solitary hut built large as a warehouse 
Loomed in the center

Tatched roof to sustain hurricane winds
The edifice had a lifted concrete-foundation

A large bonfire-pit in the center of the circular lot 

The cat with the first warning-message only-just-returned
As if only to introduce the Reaper 

Todd entered the presence of the Witch 
A mess of steaming-mass eyes aflame in vengance 

Crafty & full-of-guile is an old witch
Yet the unexpected blaze of him froze her dead heart

Slow is man to be slain bare-handed
_

When the four finally reached dunes
The cats would not near the area

Cats sitting outside the thicket in a counless ring
The cats would not enter the area
Too-tired from their massive trip to move
The group had to step over all the cats

Todd off to himself content to a corner 
_

Jewels stomached her way around the witch's hut
Parts of the witch were so-scattered-such she prayed it due-to-hungry cats 

Leatherbound tomes laid upon altars under balconys
Each balcony with a bonfire-pit
Great iron-pikes stood to hook a cauldron
_

The city was out for them
No where to go but where they were

The supply of the Witch enough to last years
Water piped from a resivoir the size of a pond 
It was kept lifted & covered
Fed by passing torrents

Firewood came pentiful off ocean drifts
Three weeks went by with even less words between them

Each kept alone to their own interests 
Each front of the plentiful fire-pits
_

Jewels absorbed herself learning the ways of the Witch
Ordained with life's calling

Weeks in the study of the tomes
Prolonged-deduction of the state of each pit

Symbols, parts & bowls, mixtures & brews

Miss created a sheild-like-tome bound by iron 
Four-tomes, two-wide two-tall

Leather-pages made from the thin flesh of the abundant dead cats
_

Jordan spent the time in exploration 

Situation of the island excellent
Built from foundation to be off-the-grid
Preserving certain utilities  betterthan County

Island isolated masked to a scene of like-islands on the coast
Each un-traversable thickets  except for small bays

A worn rock cliff dropped off to mellow-deep-ocean-waters 
One leap would exfoliate ones skin in deep-cleanse

Sea life was plentiful & transient
Jordan now satifisfied his ultimate-desire
Self-sustenance upon fresh meat killed by his own hand
_

Ben & Todd in similar circumstance
Understood each other as entirely divergent based upon their reactions

A global power now aimed to get them at whatever cost
Sent cat-assassins of wiccan conjury
Ben's dad murdered in an unknown way

The price they had paid for their decisions heavy
_

The song of every bay 
Existence ever in seasons
Day after day
Today is only
Just another day

Todd & Ben both well-healed in time
In the careful-ways of slow-healing

Ben powered his laptop to the solar-power-station

Todd kept day-long meditations, prayer, & exercise

Jordan lived in peace as if finally repaid from turbid years 

Jewels shielded with an enshrined Tome

Miss ever diligent to guide & grow Jewels talents into abilities

Driscol permenantly-closed
The five pieced together fact from hear-say around town

5 girls went missing 

One girl rumored to have shit in the same restroom
The smell so terrible the janitors refused to clean it

Other girls were all over the age of menstration

An outbreak at the hospital cost the lives of dozens of patients
Rumors of fish monsters 

Consequence of unintentional disaster laid upon Todd heavy

The past month had been chaos in the city
Under worldwide spotlight & slander 
_

Jewels & the cats kept to each other fondly
Cats avoided Todd at eyesight

Reveering Todd with gifts only as he slept

Dead rats, fish, crabs
& Plenty of money & chains

Todd took to a massive religious-piece
All made in gold large-enough-to-wield
The heft of it a precious-relic

Feline robbers stashed funds daily
In payment for fresh fish Jordan caught & Jewels prepared
All after the manner of the Witch

Jewels learnt all their names
& Kept a ledger for their transactions
_

The lengthy-trip to the city took half a day

The store was a feast paid for by the cats 
They stuffed their packs with supplies 

Sacks of food were tied to their packs
chocolate twinkies bread peanut-butter cheeses dried-meats pasta
_

Baytowns pull in lost-loiters world-wide

Each soul on drift with the tide
Drawn to far-away spheres

The library sat on the hill 
Homeless hobos just below

The Library kept an overgrown field to the back 
The lot left alone as a wild thicket

No-homeless succeeded in making any part of the thicket habitable 
Vegetation a fresh-density even fire would fail to conquer

Unknown to the city the lot had open-access to city water via an exposed water-line
A river of water from a pipe flowed thru it & continued to town

Fuel in limitless supply & limited-area 
The location was dense & impassible
_

At the turn around a corner-side-tree
The five entered the shadows of the lot

Jordan lifted a bush-arm that revealed a small path 
He stopped to turn & look at them
Jordan's characteristic move that meant something serious

'I really feel sorry for you
'Trust me
'I do

'But keep the bitching down
'There are hobos all around

Crawling, packs-first thru a maze 45 minutes 
The trail looked to be made by a rabbit

The walls were too narrow for an adult
Most movements snagged in unseeable ways

Relentlessness if tried true rewarded a scathed-body to an open scene of civility
Canopy overhead a ceiling, but all bright lit by lampposts which borderd a grassy pathway to a small-building
_

All bled

Jordan said to their bewilderment
'I put those thorns in myself

!!! WHAT

'Alright-fk-off

'I was much 
'Much bloodier
'Each scaring day
'Than you are now

'That took me 
'All winter & five jackets

'But look what we got to ourselves
'A fkn-fortress 

!daymn
'Love being forced to make that path
'A way too terrible for anyone else
'But the person who knows the end

No one was in the mood to buy into-that-reasoning
_

Dim-lights lit the completely-enclosed concrete-path 
Miss admired-always for her cheery-perspectives

'Above look 
'The foundation of this canopy

Miss pointed her shaft at a metal line

'These heavy cords
'Attached to the posts

'All for that darned Carnival-DesMondes

'If there weren't such 
'Death to the tale I'd call it a-hoot-ta-boot

'Arrogant-migrant-workers disrespected the tropical-storm
'City warned them 
'tsk-tsk
~hmph

'Only-just set-up-just-drunk 
'When the storm struck that night 

'Torments built into a Hurricane 

'From different-lands is different-fish 
'As we say

'The hurricane rearraged this area  
'These cords the only thing left of DesMondes
'No worker nor machinery left afterwards
'They are the foundation for this thick canopy
_

The path led to a utility shed 
Power & water & network

'Fort Thickets
An intricatly-carved-log branded the lot

Miss continued
'This place forgotten the years that followed Huricane Karma
'I remember having walked by it 
'How the years hide their gems

'Two-years after Karma
'Only Univeristy Hospital kept open 

'That is why University Hospital has unparalleled off-the-grid-independence
'It is the host of the entire-regions-network

Ben jolted
'The entire region 
'Networked to the same place
That is why all his route-tracers returned bogus-information

Jordan explained
Bringing the focus back
'My grandpa worked here 

'On a research-project on our ancestors
'There were several fotos of my grampa
'Taken a different parts of this place 
'At the time the grass up to the street

'I spoke to a librarian about the place

Jordan pointed to a framed paper on the wall
'Ganked that piece from the Library

The old schematic was the original building plan for the utility shed
'Hardly stealing if its doing the paper a favor
'Better placed as a shrine for one than forgotten forever by a city
_

All took comfort in the utilities & 6 stable impenetrable walls
A makeshift shower built 
Hose & a drain walled off by a tarp

Welcome after the rural lifestyle of salty baths of the island
All together in the only room missing only the comfort of fire

Jordan rationed the supplies 
The passage of life ever on serious decisions
Levity & carefree actions never native to Jordan nor Jewels
Now lost entirely to Todd & Ben

Jordan last to sit in the circle
'One night past-midnight
'Stuck on this side of town

'Crackhead-muthrfkrs 
'Everywhere tween here & Industrial

'Cold-front storm hit unexpected
'Rain soaked everywhere without four walls

'The security guard saw me 
'Loitering and maybe crying 

'He called me inside
'Let me stay until his shift ended at 6am

'I ate half of his lunch 
'I was so cold I drank an entire pot of coffee
'Never could stomach the taste before

'Man I wanted to bathe in the sink so bad
'But that would have freaked-out the guy

Jordan looked to the others
In confirmation the action was non-conventional 

'Coffee kept me in good-spirits 
'Snuck out with that building-plan

'I used pure force 
'Couldn't stop the pursuit until I arrived
'Literally

'The rain didn't breach the canopy 
'As long as I tunneled I was dry & warm

'Rabbits kept the path distinguishable
'Much easier to get thru back-then

'I had to brute-force some parts
'Hell quarter-mile crawling
'Switch-backs & shit 

'I knew the shed would still be there 
'If only four-posts & a ceiling

'But as you can see it kept good-condition 
'I did some trimming but the lamposts & sidewalk-path kept neat naturally
_

Cabin Fever a bite of polar difference
The four rested on japanese-tatami-cardbord

Electricity filled their time 
Carefree life begs obsession

Ben took a trip with Jules to return with the computer
This place more stable for electronics
Code now everpresent on the network

Now understanding the occult fundamentals of how the regions network was established
Over-time he was able to find the patterns in the gateways of packet-traffic 

The direct link to network allowed him to forge packet addresses
A large amount of traffic passed thru the Library as bridge to the inner-city
_

Ben hustled on an underground network he help enhance
Able to secure deals-around-town of rides, chores & groceries

The delievery drops the loot at the place then he would message them the map to cash 
Ben collected many names with reputation which he manuevered to get what he needed

The deal today consisted of transistors, pop-tars, Mtn-Dew ...
Well-tipped contacted offered to throw in an 1/8 of shrooms & marijuana

Ben mistook the slang & accepted 

Ben sent him the location of the payment
'$100 taped in the bottom of a bench at the Selena memorial

Jordan oathed them all to wait for an hour in the bush before entering
One of various imutable oathsworn protocols none dared breach

Feline theives gave Ben the opportunity to build many computers
The constant whir-of-activity greeted him as he opened the door arms-full-of-supplies

Jordan immediately popped up surprised 
'dayyymn dat danky
'what-choo-got-der

Bored cabin fever drove them all to sift hungrily at the supplies
Despite an inexhaustive trove of funds supplies always difficult had

'Jewels will like those
Miss said overlooking the rummage 
Rod perusing thru the items
Flinging items here & there

Ben snaped angrily
'Watch it Miss

Named used as curse matching the tone of bitch
Miss gave it to him & they both went at it

Jewels inspected the bag of shrooms lost curiously 
Branches of marijuana & shrooms on her wooden-bench
_

Jewels irate she didn't have a new tongue
Miss replied tartly
'Tongues don't just grow-for-the-pickings
'Where am I to get a suitable source & workstation
'The local hobo
'I dont herpes
_

Cats everywhere except around Todd
They had their own, quicker, narrower paths to the shed

Jules exchanged with each of the cats 
Pimping new cats nightly each arriving with offerings

Her gifts of friendship
Mixtures of feline perfume 
Jewelry & cat apparel

Cakes to fill with energy
For sex, strength, intelligence
Or just skull-fkd-delight

The once-decimated-ranks rapidly grew & grew
The Witch focused on control of the cats with orders
Jewels expanded on it with ways to express mutual interaction
_

Blood is thick with identity
Composition stirred by emotion

Blood magic draws from deep-cosmic-wells 
From which all mankind united as brother

Brew of shrooms & blood-dreched-mint leaves
Miss worked the mix into a pact of blood

Split each after the other in unbroken-chants
Chants of each all in circle in turn
Gratitude Respect Admiration Forgiveness

Trance-State-Jewels painted an intricate DIAGRAM
Great symbol encompassed each individual into the whole

'May the blood split
'Bind us five more tightly
'For affinity each to other
'Bond one to another 
'Enriched by bonds of another to another
'Each a corner with direct connection to other

Legs out connected formed a star with  stable anchors 
Cauldron laid center-circle boiled over gas stove 

Faggot of rolled marijuana & herbal mixtures
Prepared by the inexpicable mastery of Jewels

Vapor of boiled shrooms
Thick-earthy smoke filled the room

Miss lead their prayer ended in handsigns
Hot brew now cooled able to indigest

Hours-upons-hours
Moon till noon
 
Movements all-surfing-the-same-wave
In-tune at different positions of the swell

Agony of discomfort of position
Powered the motion as a fuse to weld all as one

Each looked across other in reknewed understanding
Familiar whispers assured strengthened bonds 
_

After the hours of fasting 
Cleansed-via-vomit

They took their always-packed-packs & left Downtown
Long trek thru the rabbit-tunnel passed forgotten

Instead of the left turn towards the Dunes
Jewels lead towards her old school Uptown

Miss began her story
Sure of Jewels purpose

'This school is the one of the famous Duties
'Boot-stomping-bruiser-dikes

After a quick look around at blank faces
Unsure if it was the drugs or ignorance elaborated

'I am sure you have heard of them
'The movie of them still is famous
~Bristly As An English-Boar

'Assigned to troll at Ray High 
'The two marched around so loud
'Impossible to take them seriously

'I knew the two personaly
'Eager to use the material of our encounters
'As material of jest to lead my social groups into laughter
'Which karma hit me back as I proved  long-the-fool which is yet to be forgotten

'After decades passed the women were finally put to the test
'An abductor, of no small size, took a girl 
'She screamed & screamed over his shoulder 
'Jughead sure in his strength as he was stoopid

Ben interrupted
'Yeah I've seen that
'Faces of Death covers the last-leathal-10-min-of-the-brawl
'I thought one of the sisters died

Miss hooted 
'Disfigured but then again who can tell the Twins were never pretty
'The man tho got it ugly
'After all his face all mush after the elder-sis curb-stomped-his-jaw

They were in the shade of large buildings
The school now came into view down the street

'Corpus held the record for highest kidnaps in the world
'For centuries
'Since that incident the city doesnt make a national list

'Old age has its toll
'3:30 - 3:45
'Neither can keep their eyes open
'The lure of that sweet rest into blissful wakefulness

'We have five minutes 
'Be quick

'If you see two woman coming at you
'Drop the bikes & run

The three boys blindsided in paniced-confusion
! WHAT

'We came here to steal bikes
'I didn't have time to explain
'But a warning is all you need

'Pick one fast & quiet or get face-stomped

They dove thru the entrance 
Snuck under the booth 
On-que slept the two

Every action was worrisome for them 
Jewels stitched & unseeming passager

City authorities already on the alert 
This venture had to pull off smooth
Stressed persperation bloomed from their palms
_

Lot of bikes open for choosing  
Unchained due to confidence in the Duties
Whom knew the owner of each bike

big small large neon pimp rusty caged
A selection unparalleled by any shop

Several bikes front on gold-painted rack
All other bikes allowed respectful space

Jules immediately lifted the foremost-bike on her off-shoulder 
She held the pedal with her hand

Miss chripped
'We are ready 
'Hurry hurry rats

Her bike a tricked-to-shit-bmx 

Todd took a practical road-bike after a measurement-mount
Sturdy after a decade of use

Ben hoisted up a rugged mountain-bike
The puffy tires had a relentless attitude

Jordan was sweating under his load

! are you shitting 

The four whispered in unison
The pimped out bike ostentacious

Here wasn't the place to debate
They swiftly headed out

Following Jewel's hand motions
Silent directions to keep the bikes from making noise

Unobstructed back out on the streets within 5 minutes

After the corner turn they shouted & hooted
High-speed down-hill top-speed

The four bikes bullied lanes
Blasting out onto the coastline

Jordan on a lowrider bike 
All set in chrome
Pimped-with-gadgets-lights 
Kicked-back-position drew his left lip in cool-smirk
His pack bound to top of the front tire to balance load

Finally off the high from the brew back rested bayside 
Front bonfire under night-sky at the Dunes
_

Able to act free alone on island
All attention to the moment

Each lost & gained much worth longlasting-contemplation 
Lonely states allow the soul susceptible to higher states of being
Re-enforced by need to rebuild the rubble of demolished states of being

Jewels never kept from work 
From creation of bews, mixutures, assemblies to herb dehydration
All made by hands of craftsmen of dual-minded-expertise

They all stared at Todd's replication of the DIAGRAM Jewels had drawn
She replicated it on a virgin part of the dunes at South-Moon
Large stones laid as the outline

DIAGRAM singular in fashion 
Magnetic bonds pulled all tangibly to sit in their placements
Sand would shift to form acute angles in manner defiant of science

Miss began
'All are connected by quantum-entanglements
'To kindred spirits which inhabit spheres impossibly-far

'The bond is a constant proof of infinity 
'Distance of null impact in quantum functions

'The bonds drawn deeper in interactions of dreams 
'Experiencing lives of others as Passangers

Cloud moved from the sliver of waned moon
Air often splashed with water particles sent high by waves to land on their skin

'Dagon

'His echo from AEons       
'His might truth

'Nations seek to call him forth as a gateway to divine gifts
'Tho all their world stripped upon his arrival

'The distance that seperates the cosmos is unfathomable

'Quantum properties testify 
'All realities that can pass will pass

'When one given choice possibility-nexi created
'The more divergent the possibility the stronger

'One creates universes layered over the past
'& Recalculated destiny thru consequence of action

'Possibility-Severance occurs when two-liknesses diverge to irrevocable-paths

'The distance tween cosmos is unbreachable 
'Aun for the Holy Dagon

'Contact thru human spirit consortium 
'The loop-hole exploited to sumon Dagon

'All hearts to power the other in a robust network
'Enacted together in massive movements 
'To entangle a reality thru hacks developed over aeons
'More powerful than Magnet, Gravity, or Love
'To entice Schrodinger's Cat
'To pull Dagon thru 
'In need to satisfy cleanliness of certain warped-entanglements 

'Ancient traditions passed down thru ages of civilizations 
'Led the order to confirm evidence found on an ancient-asteroid
_

'A rite to directly communicate across realities
'Experience to be shared across universes 
'Cleared of the fog of sleep into alertness of clarity

'This DIAGRAM given to us as a public gate 
'Our private understanding & connection with the symbols 
'The key illustrates to authenticate the intention 

'As a ward of protection from dagerous-minds set to lure into traps 
'Possibilities prove there are always more wise & powerful versions
'Know us as we truly are in objective perspective

'Each is their own-worst-enemy
'Each in an Order of Ourself

'Symbols associated daily 
'With their emotional attachment
'These are the armor of the soul

'The Five of us strong together
'Each as corner for other

'Our rite will be in the position we assumed during the shroom-brew
'We will bind our hands & legs in sleep during these rites 

'By purchase of comfort
'We attain a way to project to other realities
'Casting our mututal connection there in that sphere
'To draw our group to unite there 

'Able to learn on a scale of infinity 
'Which will all confirm singularity in a situation

Position tho uncomfortable laid-natural
Only a nudge dropped them down full-swing

All woke each in a different quantum reality

000000 TODD   000000000000000

All the world under a dome of earth 

Illuminesent-roots dangled dripping light from the roof 
Plants glistened in shining marvels layered the ground
Each uniquely-florescent in liquid mathematical-patterns

A boy swung a giant sword which passed thru all uncontested
Plants burst a cool mushy tastfulness of sticky goo
Todd sure it an intoxicant

Each bite gorgeous 
Yet none allowed any sense of nutritional fulfillment

The movement was hurried but anchored in a pace of endurance  
A steady of subborness that carried a hopeless-heart
Defeated yet unable to change course

He stopped to make hand-signs & speak
'My dog

'I need to find my dog
'Voice is passed to you

In any dream prior Todd could never distinguish himself
Now there was a clear-headed distinction of the presence of two

The boy stopped to make a impatient-questioning-gesture
Jordan came to mind

'Dogs
'Dogs logically gravitate 
'Towards high corners in a dome
'Like the one ahead of this gorge

Todd spoke but the words were Jordan's

'Echoes will seem to originate from each large-corner 
'The corners will draw the dog naturally 
'Each path you make will leave a trace 

'Your hack-n-slash tunnel will be a simple trail for a dog
'Your scent is carried in all this goo that drips off you

'The more corners you check
'The more opportunites for the dog
'To come across & catch your scent

Unexpected to a sudden bloom of hope
Joy burst in the boy from the epiphany

As a laugh in a quiet-room
Todd severed from the spurt 

Todd lurched up-ward still-cuffed

000000 BEN    000000000000000

Darkness 
Darkness but a candle

Turnt towards black-walls of glass
Partitioned by of different colors of ASCII text scrolling down 

Hands worked fast over many keyboards 

Keyboards laid all over on massive workbenchs facing the wall
candles memorabilia research-papers code books tea-set 

Lurching around in rolls
The man would wheel him-self about
Automatic-habitual-paths worn into wood floors

clickity clack clak 

Colorful code displayed on various terminals
Each reviewed over & over

Ben could follow and understand some logic
Tho alien-syntax all machine interaction only 1s & 0s

Characters would pour down the wall as waterfall  
Each to fill him with satisfaction never-so-deep

The man would merely scan or rapid-fire commands
Then immediately push-on to the next station  
Searching for anomolies or confirmation of work done

Ben digested the code & commented passively
The man gave no immediate signs of listening
But at times a slight pause of typing then steered towards Ben's ideas


The man grabbed a well-used box-vaporizor tube on the bench
Ben recongized the smell of marijuana

'Give me guidance 
'I have gone
'As far as I can 

With a swift habitual movements his hands made signs
Thumb connected to last two-fingers
Second & Third up stiff 

sun-pose => fall => inhale-smoke-rise => hand-sign => lower-exhale

The man took a razor to cut a symbol into the workbench

He next stood-up & stepped-back proudly at the panorama
Went to the printer to grab a blank sheet of paper

What looked like artwork was revealed  Jewel's DIAGRAM

Ben's eye jerked open 
Darkened by Todd's-shadow-siting-up
The fire longsince-burnt-out 

000000 JORDAN 000000000000000

Work 
Every second dragged

New customer
Same complaint

New room 
Same mop

In & out 
Dreary-life

Forced as cog in a inescapable system 

Pentance
Guilty of poverty
child-of-the-state

~Believe in yourself
~You can survive alone

~Take heart & leave this all behind
~Your older brother can go to hell
~For stealing your last paycheck

~Boss here is a one-of-a-kind-muthrfkr
~Use your next paycheck towards 
~a pack, bed, tarp, & weapon

~All will work itself naturally

000000 JEWELS 000000000000000

Jewels was radiant
Under sunrays that sparkled off her light-amber-hair

Her eyes emeralds
Her tongue wet 

The bike hopped 
Rail-to-wall-to-flip

Sparks trailed her as she grinded on a bench

The person shouted partly aroused 
There a deep well of sexual desire

He looked down at roadbike-cleats 
Clicking metalically back to the roadbike

00000000000000000000000000000

All awoke together but all felt the exit natural 

Time was null
Dimension past traditional lines of perception

'This symbol here 
Ben redrew the polygon sign the man etched in the work-bench

'I want that tattooed across my knuckles
_

Jewels poked with a sunbleached fish-bone
Steadied-by-her-lack-of-empathy-for-pain

Dipped in root of an herb & ink of octopus 
Peppers & other mixtures to accenuate the fine lines

The symbol beautifully portrayed upon Ben's left-fist
Augmented by the artistic-mastery of Miss 

A simple-but-intricate masterpiece
Black-symbols turned to light-brown-red under the sun

The project became an ordeal which never stopped
Symbols & Shapes expounded from knuckles up the arm
Amplified in patterns of certain-dreams
_

Night prior fumed rites of sativa induced sleep 
Dunes on Friday dawns after a closing-bonfire

The nights were warm
Felines in hundreds lay on them
One moved off to be replaced by another

Blanket of warm-fluffs
Connected the five 
In a web of heat

Wakeful dawn tides set calm-stages 
Passive scenes for pre-planned actions 

For Todd that first meant training & habitualizing mind & body

Dr. Yang-Jwing-Ming taught him the fundamentals & forms
These forms he would practice then move on to shadow-boxing

The others were always very helpful to spar against
Each had their own style of agression
Jewels was a clever brute force all-in push
Jordan only ever defensive, while Ben grappled

Ironic that time in the girls the day they met was the only ever win
Ben now had mastered the counter to Todd's technique with a greater vice

Two hours left his body exhausted but his mind awakened
His prayers were coupled with yoga poses

Prayers were contemplation, mantras, readings, writing
Western praktice of sacrifice hardened his core with repitition & resilence

Most decisions in life have no bearing to good, evil or neutral
Philosohy & sciences oriented his decisions always to gravitate to a larger reason

Thru the use of constant & everpresent themes
Todd praktised artes of instant divination

Tho the moment was entirely new & relational
Endgames constant & clearly laid paths

Todd noted all their dealings in a record which he kept without fail 
_

Adventure returned them always to the city
Flock migrations in tune with the season

Spot to spot to spot
All knew the destination
If seperated they all would meet at the next spot

Each had a pack of their core items
Each location had accumulated stashes
_

Miss kept on Jewels to grown her own plants

Power of plant-magik
Unlocked thru engeries of service given to the plant
Sexual-pain in orgasm of the pluck
Never to cut them only guide them with cords

Soil wasn't plentiful at the Dunes
Nor was the enviornment kind to plants
Gusts kept all vegitation stunted 
Salt dehydrated all to a hardened bark

Massive acres of Texas farmland surround the city
Miss was sure there would be a region to sneak a garden
A hidden cultivation of plants with access to irrigation
The harvest moon waned to orange/redish tints
Forgotten & unused acres would be obvious as cultivated lands were weeks past harvest
_

Friday nights alotted for long-suffering-adventures
Jewels had nurtured month-old-plants
Each nested on the bikes

Tonight was long ride to the outskirts
15 kilometers only to arrive at the border

These plants would find home or die
The roots could not sustain a return journey

Jordan welded a hitch for a one-wheel-trailer 
The pimped-position kept his feet outstresched ahead
Riding low against minimal air-resistance

Agitation on the plants unavoidabley to scar them with a sense of insecurity
Roots would grip peaceful-plains with a steadfastness from that experience 
_

Across town & down roads past horizons
Each passing truck honked
Calling them out as stranger: noticed & remebered

Holligans up to no good
The plants probably drugs
_

Hours passed into moonlight

Jewels finally stopped arms skyward outstreched
Sensing the energy of a wishful-place

Miss affirmed with air-of-pride
'Yes 
'Deep-water in the air

'Jewels your ability is second-to-none
'You dear gem

Jordan keen to practical-ingenuities
Bikes stashed inside an overgrown-roadside-drainage

Jordan always covered them with a dark tarp
He locked the set with his handy-chain

'The bikes will leave too obvious trail
'Without the bikes, if we move careful
'Passerbys won't distinguish the foot-path
_

Jewels carried her pepper-plant

The strand her variation based on the Witch's main-root
But it was heavily grafted with modifications

Peppers kept off parasites
Peppers helped keep meat
Leaves produced thick-smoke

10 Acres they walked single-file
All infested with dark-red-ticks
 
Mosquitos & gnats feasted 
Bugs bit at their salty-sweaty-bodies in a frenzy

A small hill loomed in the horizon 
Leakage off the hill made the path difficult

Mud caked their shoes till ankles
Shins sliced by serrated-leaves

Jordan pointed at rusted-hinges of the gated hill shut for decades 
Overgrown the gate could only be hurdled

Signs of long-abadonment
An old camp chair next to a rusted-thru-tin-bin 
Decades-old-crushed-beer-cans crunched everywhere

Strewn about were odds-that-spoke-of-a-person who kept this place as private-quarters 

Miss commented still worn from the journey
'It must have been a miserable-fool 
'To keep this parcel-of-hell a lounge

Jordan said assured of the hill 
'This is definitely manmade

Tho molds of the hill that had longsince-become-organic
'The plains-dirt causes this shit-pit
'No cohesion to let the water run smooth

They twisted & curved, blazing a path up

Plants thick & greedy for space
Full of things that crawl & bite
Foliage 10-feet-high at places

The path broke to grassy knoll at its summit 
Plateau larger than what-looked-possible-from-below

A dark plane circle lay flush with the ground 

Miss had a habit of annoying them with her poetry
'A dark portal  
'Sacred pillar

'Reflection without ripples 
'Harvest-moon bore mirrored

Each soaked the sweat & tourtures of raw flesh
Little fish nibbled away the crusts of skin & ticks

Miss explained 
'The Downtown Memorial architect
'Once described the difficulty of the process 
'To engineer a water-mirror

~proof of mastery
'Where his words

'Here is one formed by more than happen-stance 
'The reflection adapts stabalizing to perfect reflection

Wild grass held a lush Kentucky Green, cool & soft 
Blades of it clung as moistured-gauze
Balm on tired, bit & sun-baked-flesh

Two hours past in preparation of the banks 
The four turned the soil with whatever was at hand

The removed grass replanted in care
So beautiful the summit vegetation

Jordan retrieved the still-serviceable barbque-pit 
They alloted a section of the bank for the DIAGRAM constructed with washed-pebbles

Miss conducted rites over metals, wood, mineral
Marijuana was dashed over the top
Each hovered over the flames chanting after Miss

Plants first incensed to calm their nerves
Planted atop the rite materials as bed to the roots
Set to be untouched for a time

Dawn broke as all positioned at the DIAGRAM
Taken by sleep upon carpet of Kentucky Green

All looked across to other
Each sat legs-crossed settled-to-a-balance past comfort 

A large wick candle blazed-crackily in the center
Mint perked-attention of the passangers 
A thin-metal-couldron boiled hanging over the candle

Omnious sounds crept upon wakened concious 
Till it stood before their sense full-frontal

'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh

The words melded to their minds
Unable to capture the words as one grasps smoke

Moon bordered by stratus clouds

Jewels eyes burst-widely-open
! the arrival

'3 long years to summon 
'Many have come & gone
'But only thee we seek

Surrounded by mirrors on all sides
The Mirrors enlade by a dark purple hue metal

She bowed in introduction
'I am The Grand Prophet
Jewels spoke in firm-beauty

Adorned by all-fine-things, one apparent
A tiara laid by fine workmanship 
Fish-bones & pearls worked into gold

'A monk life is paid in sacrifice
'To bless infinite-realms
'We beseech thee remember this chant

Conciousness whirled smokey as brew
All turned-together into a vision 

Destruction a simple devastation
Earth processed into a dark purple planet of dust

'Thru the hull of your reality 
'Doom will breach our portal

'Every existence in our net
'Will be nullified

'Work of each generation from the beginning
'All to end in the purpose of Dagon

Swirled world righted back front the mirrors 
She inhaled the incesnse chanting deeply

Her eyes turned 
They moved as handsigns did in exact patterns

'Prepare
_

All woke slowly entranced by chant
A chant intelligble due to ryness-of-mouth 

Eyes welled by deep-tears-of-agony

Each across the other sore of bound-legs
Drug themselves heavily to the banks of of the resivour
Not for hours did they speak

Jewels too put-out to set out a healing-vapor
All put-out & passed-out on-and-off

Unable to sleep-deep thru pain-present-misery
_

Miss still slept 
The instant Jewels woke Miss collapsed of exhaustion

Jewel bore hard-amounts of dried-caked-blood in her throat 
Trance lasted two days & nights

Prophet Jewels dealt them great harm 
To wretch them so wickedly in suffering-unparallel

~Prepare
A message that cost agony
Themselves they found were
Ones greatest enemy
_

Moment Miss woke
Miss creaked out
'Dagon will be summoned
'but what force can stop
'a gateway built by
'thousands of years

'great minds of the world failed
'pent-up power so great
'the order can only succeed
'over all realities
'required ends to set it-self-right-in-motion-with-quantum-entanglements

With no food they were forced a laborsome-journey to Jordan's nearest location
A lot behind a car-lot out to the back near highway 

Old water & dry food to soothe them back to health

Next-winter-months at the Library
Winter a bitter-time of sunless-days under a moist frozen canopy 
Passive to the paths of constant-northern-gusts 

~ fK-this-damn-stub
Jewels communicated by unmistakable gestures

Jewels argued with Miss in cabin-fever
Miss would often only rap Jewels on the head

Hot but stuffy in a one-wall-cabin
Most silent in misery

All failings of the flesh & imperfections intensified

Jordan spoke up
'Lets go back to the Dunes
'Rather have a few bad days
'Then to have all shitty ones

'For-fks-sake

'We all have a public bowel clockwork 

'Jewels shits 6am
'Todd always at 7:13
'Ben shits after lunch
'I shit before sleep

Ben snapped back annoyed
'I cant just pick up & leave

Keystrokes the hammer of his mood

'Code takes time to set up
'Before I can think of walking away

'We might not be able to come back
'For a months
'The Undernet is based here 
'If it fails major portions will fail

Todd pointed out simply so even a cat could understand
'We been here over a month

Ben got up from the computer

'Dude I tell you all the same things always
'I am refining mechanics

'But to refine the mechanics in code
'You got to take it apart

'Let me rebuild the modules then we go
Ben had gotten back down to begin typing
After ten minutes passed

'A new drop is coming
'Jewels

He turned toward her
She in a hiss

'The trailer for your bike
'You know the one to stash your Tome in

Her smile melted the fever of all
Happy the rest of her day in a merriment for all

A week would be required to prep it with all the layers of paint
Necessary before Jewels would attach it to her bike

Todd jealous of the master of Ben to diffuse the situation
'Well we do need some coffee-n-shit

Jordan's phrase word all adopted 

click clack
'Wanted: 1/8 shrooms & lb whole-bean-coffee & jelly-beans
Ben threw an accusative finger at the tatami-mats

'Jordan built those for streching
'Yall need to be busy doing that

'You might not know 
'How you are supposed to 
~Prepare

'But as for me I got a damn-good-idea
'Allow secure communications to a region
'Connected to the larger-world by a large-degree

'If mankind is going to battle with some God
'They will communicat without interception

Jordan added to the situation
'None of my skills are new
'Far as my 
~Prepare
'Got that smack-on-tack

Todd ashamed agreed to the same
His strength was meditation & contemplation
~Prepare
A high-priced-message of no personal-value

Computer mainframe heated the utility-flat
Five monitors mounted on the wall

Boxes all mounted on the ceiling
He controled them via his laptop

10 machines mounted of various shapes
Wires of rainbow-sort intertwined them

Ben typing on his lap would look up to see results in the network
Results a flow of ASCII which mezmerized the rest in the way of the flame
_

Jewels & Jordan picked-up the drop

Caffine obnoxiously powerful 
Brew would meld into the high
Enlongating time of the trip

6 hours straight Miss convinced them to meditate 
Miss was never wrong in these promises

Breatheing in a brew
Cooking over the large flame of Jewels hand-made-candle

Miss instructed
'just a tttthhhh

'no hauking please
'i will hang you on a cross
'rapt you head hard on

Streching each other in pulls 
All bound to the circle

Tomorrow after all was skate-day
Skater-krews all over the city would skate spot after spot
Until they caught wind of the united Corpus Horde
_

Ben used the trip to work out his code
For the routines to mesh orgainically

Mechanics of code are finnicky & specific
Interfaces must have structural-soundess
Code must be industrial grade
To support ever-present traffic 

Computer-nodes networked together by homogeneous-unix-kernels
Each would tap into the network on some distributive task

Files, messages or listings all sent in a P2P cloud 
Ben's UnderNet now a major player in all the region
He became what is known to the populous as worship

Only the two nodes would know of the connection
Only the process on each end could decrypt the packets

The regions network packets only analyzed & routed at central
The network allowed him to make explicit-ip requests to any node if both ends configured

His various machines ran different versions of the protocol in redundancy
Trial server should last the next months which if succeeded would prove it good for years
_

Ben took a backseat past weary-exhausted
Drank coffee & blunted-up
Green Bull

Passangers prompted keystrokes in novel sophistication

Miss stated 

'One enlightens all
'Entangled neural connections associated with understanding
'Natural paths created my mechanical electrical piping 
'Quantum Entanglements form the groves of these neural-piping 
'New connection created is an echo out to the rest
'Connection tho dormant forever may also prove a deeply treasured trove

Ben hacked away
Almost the last one up
Todd would never be defeated 

New server was up & responsive for 10 minutes
Good enough for him Ben slept

Todd grateful he dis-mounted position & laid down on his tatami-mat-mold of a bed
Masters of his method clocked their progression by length of meditation
A race against Ben is always an inspiration worth any journey
_

Jordan always went first to break wind
Low the the ground wind-low-resistance

Jewels next with the Tome trailer
A massive chain jingled in a coil under the Tome

Todd was next with Ben to follow
Fat tires heavy for the long-haul

Nearby school lots all empty
Skaterless lots on a Friday
Only meant one thing

Horde had already been this way

Ben went up to a old couple walking their dog
Sight of him startled the couple

He was drenched in sweat & labored
~hey you seen a bunch of skaters

Old couple only looked back defensively 
Dog in front held in firm protection

Jordan yelled sommething obscene as they left
_

Horde at a house-party on the wealthy-side
A caged tiger roamed the lot

Host taking Jewels to present around
Miss well-dead-asleep in her stomach

She would bust a stationary bike-trick if the host prompted her
Ben would follow Jewels tail & get connections

Jewls & undernet-guy are friends the gossip 
Ben with usb on hand which he would trade for ganja 

Todd & Jordan busy with a guy busting on a teen girl
Both didn't much care to be those other guys

Afterwards troll around packs-hardcore
Two modernized adventureres
rolls, rope, gear

People would always talk or prove up

'I had to drink water from a toilet
'You use toilet paper to filter

'Did you know you could use toilet-paper in a nuclear situation?

Solid-advice from druggies
Weathered in the experiece of horrible situations

Masion on the ocean side
Rooms & rooms filled with its own special thing

Owner not around to be seen once
Someone from each school present

USB traded for party-pleasantries
shots hits motorboats around-the-house

Code of high value with the new version
Paid higher keys on the network for usage

Not till 3am did the two groups meet back up again
Each trailing their own party of need-a-place-any-place

Industrial would be a real muthrfkr
But there was no place else

Jordan gave the Talk
Each in turn he oathed

...blah blah blah
third-party-heresay-result-in-our-death

4 of them left the next day only to return with bikes
Crew of 8 could manuever anywhere and be uncontested

Promised journey to the Garden
By choices people led to them
Once in their prescense familiar
Love & devotion to cause like-wise

A large girl named Manda
Two twins named Greg & Steve
Kikochi Japanese who still learnt english

Each hauling an item dictated by Miss
Trucks past but they didn't heed any

Always several kilometers down a single direction
That direction improbable to be tracked down
_

Jordan sworn on his oaths
'Trust me there is going to be a cat waiting for us

Greg took it as mis-interpret
'Or some cat just living there & you show up

On que sat dead-in-the-middle
Calico flag waved back & forth

Kikochi played the flute on Jewels request as they appraoched

Kikochi caught his breath at the sight
A sacred pool in different manners but same fashions of his heritage

Plants saturated the air in a hum
A great-greenery amassed on the knoll
Polished stones bordered the mirror-pool

Greg awknowldged defeat
'What does the cat eat while you are gone
'big-ass-bag-of-cat-food
'caz if so my friend you forgot it

Jewels 
~Millions of mice in these fields
~Many pests to feed the cat

Cat obviously communicating in short clear purrs
They tended to the plants & harvested after a long-soak

'Oddish
'how you say
'Creepy
Kikochi struggled to accustomize himself with the fish nibbles

Manda dived under & back up to momentarily breach the reflection
'Makes me feel more natural to this world
'You know 
'Two organisms in same enviornment help other along
'Not exploiting or molesting the other

'What you say
Kikochi pointed to his dick
'One earlier bit my penis

Jewels splashed his way 
~Ate tick off 
'favor for you

Experience too creepy for the Twins they only cuped water into a bath
The night wore on and the four felt a calling near in foreboding

Kikochi finished a song to re-align-the-mood

Jordan started moment he finished
'We are going to be in a state

Greg accepted eagerly
'Yea we got you guys

'spray your face with water
'dont laugh when you shit-all-over

Todd blushed as his were always diahreeah

Miss directed out the large ceremonial-candle-column
Jewels moved it in pain for how long & tedtious the candle took to make
Thin Couldron full of a gallon of herbs & water

0 united 00000000000000000000

Stillness of infinte darkness 
Slowly unfolded to chanting
Then to the sense of color baby-blue
Smell of familiar plants
Taste of familiar drink woke them full

Jewels silver-hair tiara
Laid middle of the pond

Platform invisible as if floating
Silver hair now glinted to her mermaid-scales

She lead weary the same chants
Only the words now audible

'Dagon the dragon
'Is coming thru you

Jewels burst emerald-orbs-up-at-to-them
Voice cracked unaccustomed to many words

'You will lose your battle against Dagon
'There is no change in that fate

Mermaid waved the water with her tail 
'Be assured
'Many fates await after the Arrival

She drew them in with a longated-cigar
'Image of Dagon
'A clone of entity

'Each reality Dagon links an Image 

'You must find a way to kill Dagon's Image

'If Dagon killed in one reality
'God will revert to its state in a previous realm
'Infinity upon infinity in a chain-link

'If Image of origination is destroyed os the link of origination
'Dagon would be worn down by more possibilites of death

'Dagon will eventually die & be severed of link
'It would be repelled back to its image whence it came

'Lot fated to fail 
'Learn to survive  

All melded as water-drained

Woken each in fron the other
5 days past 

Jewels bowed to the four friends
All of whom had kept loyal to duties

~The suffering of this time less
~More power for longer time
~More clear the summon

Chili-tea brewed with herbal-leaves
Sustained them quickly to bearable-state
_

Twins rearranged the shed 
All the supplies were gone

Group managed to produce recipies of the vegetation abundant here
Jewels eager to write them all down astounded with Miss at this discovery 
_

Symbols now major part of their life
Together they set upon a symbol to remeber the moment in a tattoo
Inscribed on the body all hady vacant

Flags to awaken a sleepy-passangers in alertness of remembrance
Symbol as anchor to keep them united by this interaction 

Mermaid laden with the symbol
Tiara to the embroidery of pearled skirt
_

Morn after that long adventure of the crew
Under the hot sun at the crossroads they all met

The three boys went their back to their homes
Manda stayed with them grateful to be far from home

Easy coastline hills over bare bike-trails
Thru some thickes & back to the Dunes

Full moon an initatory dive
Despite many wails from Manda

Jewels & Mandy in girl-time
Manda had hair too-thick-curly for the sand
They spent long hours molding her dredlocks
_

~fk-the-world
Jules flipped-the-bird

Bonfire in fast from want of food

Todd lead them
'Our reality will be destroyed
'Others will likely forsee it

Jordan inturrupted
'Streets will always have
'Some symbol associated with a movement 

'Like grafiti or flags

Miss added 
'Agreed that is wise
'We must each await this

'Our possibility is not the first on this issue
'Our movement linked to a greater of the whole

'The right symbol will be obvious to all

Ben tossed in
'We were told to survive
'Ground-zero will be the most logical cover

Jewels signed
~Eye-of-the-hurricane 
~Or be nuke-city

Jordan continued
'The image must be secure
'Near the portal I agree will need to be a stable-enviornment

Todd joined
'Presence on the inside

'Why go thru years of chanting
'To give out a hopeless warning

'All-ever passed-in-this-existence 
'Consumed as meal for one-being-alone

'I mean to save our world as-well

Jordan looked up with a face reserved before a long rant
'Nests-hella-infest 
'Always centers a fat-bitch-queen 

'We know the school 
'Been there three-years
'Who over us best to break-in to the Uni

'Todd you still got that key

Todd nodded in a subtext that he never let anything go 

Jordan lit up excited
'Finally 
'Xena 

Eyes up in the sky standing arms outstreched circled in the sand
'In my arms soon

All some-how creepily knew -that- about Jordan
Individual discoveries that need not be remembered 

Manda looked around confused
? Xena

Jewels turned her to herself
~stuffed-giant-panda
~used-for-humping 

Jewels rode the air giving winks at Jordan
~Left in Jordan's locker 

Jordan smiled
'Hey our kind has Pride
'Xena is the love of my life
_

Regional network routed thru University Hospital 
One key likely existed as a backdoor all data & service

Ben rambled on as he hacked away on his beach-puter
They were all front a fire
Night-times best for dark-terminals & batteries

'Any pattern would betray itself eventually
'Birthday-coincidence-proof

'Eventually can be hacked quick
'If you are clever enough

Manda opened an adoration
'Ben the most 1337 hacker around
'Damn-son kill-it yo

Jordan caught it
'ttttahh
'I never say kill-it

Ben continued
'Todd you never asked me 
'Why I was chased that day we all met

All chewed roasted-pepperoni 
Front of a bonfire waves breaking near-by 

'Anytime I was at a computer at school
'I waited for a chance to create a listener

'I created code that would talk to other nodes I set up
'All were set to link together every morning from 1am-4am

'It was my first major hack

Manda hooted
'pimped-out-them-bitches-like-hotcakes

A long banter that fell dead on the audience

Ben took back up
'I set up only one program to run
'It would send data to each other in roundrobin
'All data would be collected to find a pattern

'If a mod-x over the data set was found that was intelligent

Ben annoated
'as long as it was cryptic a kernel cant read it

'When it reads correctly each node is to sent a print request to a printer
'I stole one from an insurance office that fked my dad over
'Set it up in the janitors closet under the stairs
'The back part wasnt used and all I had to do was splice a nearby line

'Hid in the jacket-closet of Mrs. Stevens till everyone left 
'Stayed locked up in the room with a few bottles to pee in & some snacks

'Then I setup the printer & went back to sleep in the gym until PE woke me

'My dad flip-ta-bich-&-slappped-me-good next time I sent him 
'Turned out my plan to get away with it flopped miserably

'I got impatient & after a month I got desperate

'I counted & waited till the Monitors 
'All returned after their trolls

'I was in the middle of the hall
'They left to go deal with Todd

'Mr. Dumbass walking around

'That code should be cracked
'I have it written down
'I know there are no errors

Todd reacted
'You mean you have faith

Ben didn't take the bait
'Breaking into that unity
'I agree to be our most important task

'With that key all traffic would be plain-text to me

Jordan patted Jewels on the shoulder
All always rightly blamed her for their summons
'Maybe we sell ourselves too short
'Who else in the world
'Could get access like that

'Get the data
'Plant an encrypted-bridge

'All seems prophecy to me

Insomnia the soil of Ben's childhood
Night the time daddy popped-caps

If Ben didn't keep actively moving spots
Pops always managed to find him 
No matter how drunk he was

Popped-a-skull worse the-longer-it-took
The decision to run crossed-a-line 
Trespass forgotten after the haze-of-afternoon
All rant & abuse until then

~cost of new school shoes
~ones kicked aside-disrespectfully

~coulda ate McDonalds 
~Not that shit-which for lunch
~Two-mins to prepare
~Only free two-mins 
~of the gawddamnday

Ben easily avoided the clumsy-lunatic 
His dad's favorite state-of-being

The key was to get out of sight
Which was easier said than done

Once out of sight jump in a nook
He built lights in various places
Always kept a tool-set-flashlight in his pocket
Ben used the time to read until he recently got a laptop

That the best time to read
If Ben caught lounging with a book

Pop would put a wail on him
Harden his skin & slice with a tongue

'If you didn't mark it
'There was no point 
'Have'n to remember it
'Der dipshit

His dad would lecture him then hit him 
Accentuated by the alertness of a hurt
Some sensitive point to be taught over & over

'If there wasn't no point 
'Of have'n to remember it

'Then why the fuck 
'Would you read it boy

'We elect you
'Mayor Dipshit

Ben looked-up to his dad 
Despite his weaknesses as a father

Man cracked to the core
Stuck as single-parent
To provide all in a hard world

Pop would steal textbooks from the city library
Learn Ben up on subtle-arts & tricks too keen for school

Ben would wait in the car front the library
Always on rainy days

'Need a reason to stay hooded-up son 
'Two coats to steal-large
'Remember that one

His dad's favorite was a artic military coat

Wisdom imparted in payment for guilt
Whate remained after hazey memories
Witness to own weakness

Gleaming as a redeemed-man does
Passing down a lesson-for-the-ages
Endorphins-high rewarded from evolution

Returned with two large textbooks of random sort
Displayed like hunted-food for a starving-family

Dad always taking Ben as ingrate

'Listen shithead 
'When you get the balls that drop 
'And the skills like mine

'Only then 
'Do you deserve choice 
'Which kind of fruit-of-the-tree you able to eat

Ben's dad a true muthrfkr 
The type to fk around casual 
Leave a virgin stuck with a babe for 2 years

Gathered courage to come back to raise him single-handed
A fact that Ben used as pillar to keep the image of his father holy

While day-to-day was a kick-around
Kicked around in day-to-day bullshit

Fresh memories of this father
Understood now of his fathers sober-intention
Before Alcohol dramatized the scene 

Kick-Ben-for-sport
A technique that kept Ben awake & reading
_

Ben eventually took up the tricks of his dad 
Ben had a trove of out-of-date-unix-books 
Black-screen command-line-terminals

~To lift up the shell
~To hear the C

Kerigan & Ritchie & Richard-Stevens 
Homogeneous kernel of unix networks
_

Pops gave it as his birthday-gift
Presented always as payment
After listening to one-of-his-life-lessons

'Shit you never know
'When shit gets real
'Cops be busting in

~oink ~oink

'They search evidence

'& Where is the USB
'Full of all the evidence?

'4 Inches out of the puter
'Down your throat
'Before any seent you

'All incriminating-evidence 
'In your shit
Dad down-to-earth genius
Which he wore too-proudly
_

Each year Pops needed less & less alcohol
Reading always a sensitive subject

Ben caught with a book in one of Pops moods

'Learnt is fine & well 
He would slurr & slap 


'But boy tell-you-me 
'no MAn would choose 

'that bull-onie-bull-shit
'for some-real-life-skills

Kick Ben out of the room
Kick the book to the floor

'piss on books
'only fools follow

Laugh'n maniacally as if front audience
Ben would have another mess again to clean

Quicker better as piss congeals worse each moment

Library full of distorted piss-stained books
All his highlights distored in the wrinkled-dried-paper
_

Pop phrases that always popped back into Ben's mind
'----like that fkn cop'
'----like your bitch ma'
'----like ....'
_

Six together around the large pit
Life taken in seriousness requires fast

Ben said accidentally interrupting the silence

'lets see anyone else 
'Takeover a whole region's traffic
'fknmuthrfkr

'thank-god-some-one-spoke
Manda said getting props from Jewels

Miss took the rebellion steamed
~Prepare

'Oh right wit you gurl
'Just me I prefer to prepare on a full stomach
Manda up in a rawl in her own laughter

Food cooled to cold front laid as picnic
Center of the circle for hours

To busy in meditation or stationary-task
Hours of silence snowballed energies
Entangled to break an understanding

Stronger & stronger each passing second 
All united in the deep fight of will over matter

Ben on a laptop
Jewels knit, caligraphy, tattoo, potion 
Todd pen-set-out write down histories 
Jordan keep the fire & cook

Hana would make comments that Jordan was their butler
Jordan would comment back that she was promoted to his job

Miss lectured
'Starvation-bonds a deep well of power
'Exploited by the effect of pseudo-starvation

'Hunger in proximity of-smells-of-food 
'Will quick-trigger a state of pseudo-starvation
'An attempt to use all power to adquire food

'Vast wells of energy
'Fuel power of Passangers

'Starved host receptive
'Passanger acute of power

'Lessons by masters
'More fortunate in the reality of host-situation

Difficult to attribute work to yourself
Or product of a silent-passanger

All now ate the cold food in deep gratitude
Somberness an ashe coats pleasures of life all grey 
Difficult at times when to attribute a work to yourself

Todd since a child devoted himself to edification
Meditation, supplication & fasts 

Miss admited respect for Todd's intuition 
400 years with his example unparalleled

Pools of energy bloomed miracles in Todd's dream-state
He led as Passanger
Hosts thru their questions to fill holes of understanding
_

Todd rant:

'We will never know 
'A thing about anything

'As animal the world around
'Too grand for any to grasp 

'Points-of-perspective blind eyes
'In truncations of viewpoint

'I commit to morals
'Morals only modified 
'After any act itself

'To stand firm at times main point

'Quantum reactions
'Actions & ability refined open doors next-level
'Monuments of life done day-to-day

'Answers life gives us
'Decisions all come at cost

'Jerk-off, play-tag, school

'All sacrified for one or two
'Mathematics & Kungfu

'Kinetic logic built as route
'Stable functions of properties 
_

'All morn towards kungfu
'Wake me into algebraic-groups 
_

Prayers chats to allign mentalities
Ease a sleepy Passanger into speak
_

Mathematical theory worked out in notepads
In pursuit of the reason why they were asked
_

Ben mentioned excited to Todd a while back
'I have Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's compilation
'My dad stole them all 
'He told me if the chinks discovered he was selling the secrets of their culture he would die
'Stealing his books were essentially helping to save his life
'I also have alot of mathbooks
'Dad stole those for their size

Ben continued
'They are at a storage-container
'We could haul the lot with our bikes
_

Manda had to head back home for the next months
They took turns off-the-cliff waves large

Jordan jumping up to baby-blue-air
'Hella-doe-boys

Long echoe into a crash of water
He swam up to approach the gathered friends

Todd presented the idea
'We bike Manda home
'Then we get a load of library-books from Bens shed

Jordan entering agreed
'Book no-one uses
'slang-dat-shit 
'fat-wads 
'got-any-porn?

Ben countered
'Or mad points
'With the Library 

Ben now a bit catchy of voice
'Dad stole to create a library to name after himself 

Ironically truth that the stolen books else not be preserved
_

** ** ** (stop)
Jordan looked back

** ** ** (stop)
Jewels flashed lamp-code

Three trucks charging from behind
Headlights scanned thru streets that specifically were the fastest route to the group

Jordan hooted in a small call
'shit-gonna-git-real

Section of the city vacated & decrepit residential neighborhoods
Jordan chose an entry-point to cross thru the street-blocks diagonally

Leaped thru the debris in the back-yard
Jewels tome-busted thru the fences

Back on their bikes repeated block after block
The rednecks not to be out-witted 

Roar of truck lurched near then immediate
Black mass dove into view thru the backyard in a woosh-of-disaster
Truck bouncing on Supper-Dude-Springs as it crashed thru debris

Hood over the engine heavily-fortified hull 
Earth was lifted then scattered in a large-chunk

Truck drifted-to-a-J over wet-foliage overwhelming in the overgrown yard

!!! HONK 
!!! HONK HONK HONK

Dirt & Plants blasted over the collapsed fence set between them

'Them there it is
! DATS
'Billys Bike!
! GIT EM

A hardy-bearded-oldman screeched in wolf-howl
Stumbling-out drunk or dazed-stoopid-from-the-crash

'My late-wife
'Gave thatta my grand-son Billy

!you-gonna-paaaain

Speach allowing the krew time to pass out & thru

Two-other-trucks approaching rapidly

Enviornment grumbled in groans-of-the-rowdy-passage
_

Four hauled-ass thru then down a street perpendicular

Movement as flock 
Jewels now in the the lead 

They at times followed in great pain
Unable to match Jewel's jukes

They curved in circle 
Second-to-last-house 

Kept a sound-structure
No-front-door allowed quick-entry
Swift headlights passing moments after

Todd whispered
!up-the-stairs

Stairs held but the passing felt-soggy

Trucks outside in mad charges
Wolves nosing thru the neighborhood learching

Overestimating the stretch 
Null to their dominant position
_

Eventually trucks pulled around to circle back

A voice shouted
'Billy you keep dat 
'outer-perimiter

'We gonna handle all here

A hoarse, cracked teen voice yeller
'Run-em-down-dead
'As christ on the cross

Howls out the truck windows called
! got my shotty
! pump-yer-ass-wit-salt

!!! ooooohhhhhwwwwwweeee 

!!! YIP

!!! saves-ya-to-feed-as-bacon-to-my-pigs

Five shadows moved as a group from one house to the next
First pumped in riot bashing-deep-inspection lords of earth

House by house heedless of effort imperceptiple at such levels of intoxication
At the umpteenth house the hunt became a labor

A hard & disgusting labor to search abadoned houses
Vomit-inducing sights met them unexpected

A fat man huffed his way to gather the squad

! you-wit-me
! bobby-go-wit-earl
'We got this hous ere 

Hoots of compliance
!Chk er down
!chk ER down
!chk-er-down

Moments later a crash & bash down stairs of their building 
A crash at the stairs followed by a curse

! fuckaroo
'damn-fuck-cock-bite-stair
'jimmny-crickets-whore-of-a-mother


! BOBBY 
! EARL

! pull-er-ass-here
! help-me

A voice went outside to call out to the trucks
! dumbass-dipshit-hurt-himself

Four others helped carry the wounded grey-beard to a truck

! HEY YOUS
! FUCK FUCKAROOS

! DIS HERE TRUCK
! CALL HER


!!! RUMBLE
!!! RUMBLE 
!!! RUMBLE

! DOOOMM
! HAMMMERRRR

Loud-screech lost itself in the maniacal throttle & Heavy Metal on 808s
Two at each side of the truck hefted chains

Driver rolled down the a window-shield
The truck had a logo

~Bobbys Best
~WRECK & CLEANUP

'ole-mother-fucker
'is paid to clear this shit
'how-fucking-funny-is-that-boys
'donet earnt yerselves proooofesssionales

A shrill accusative yipped 
! THiEVry

Justified the truck took out the corners of the first house on the block
Two on each side would link the chains to the pillars of each house

! I-aINTA-WURKED-DiS-HaPPy-SINCE-VEGAS
One worker shouted glove on the right hand
A fith-of-something-cheap in his left hand
Leather-utility-belt hung a laborer-hammer

Pace & efficiency alarmed the group

'fuckohfuck
Jordan trapped in despair
'Gotta keep it real

Todd pointed thru the lookout window
'They left the hurt guy the smaller truck 

'Imma sneak up behind
'Take him down

Todd convinced them
'We only survive if we get a vechicle
'With bikes we lose

Jordan nodded
'Take over the truck then reverse here
'We throw the bikes in the bed & skurr-skurr

Jordan offered
'Ill back you up

Todd declined
'I move better alone
'Just be ready

All relied on surprise
Two would double the chance to be noticed 

Failure puts Todd as distraction if nothing else
Chance for the others to escape an otherwise sealed-fate

Hand-to-hand combat a dependable solution
Loud noise or honk would doom the venture 

Todd left out the kitchen window 
He followed bushes along the front

Section by section Todd silently neared the truck
Snail-like movements put him under the rear-cab driver-window

A locked-driver-door would mean his luck ended 
Tonight was not their night to die

Drunk ass rednecks wouldnt have locked the door
In a solid thrust up the handle locked-halfway

A voice inside rose
'whadda
! whatdafuck 

Todd's heart dropped yet a Passanger had a trick ready
~Back Bed

Todd swung himeself onto the back bed

The truck lurched on as Todd scrambled upright
Four wheel drive thru rumble of the front bushes to land on asphalt of the road

Todd on a bull-of-a-ride
Thrown hard here-&-there

Guy caught-up in manual-transmission with one unusable foot
Old man meant to get to the other truck which would doom Todd

Rednecks always have something in the bed able to break a window
Todd grabbed down at metal-rod
The truck-bed jolted left to crash his shoulder into a tool box

Wheels purchased pavement again
Todd was bleeding but no time to tend wounds

Todd immediately obliterated the back window 
Over-swung-rod continued to a red-line across the-head

! yyyyeaaaaoooohhhhhh

Driver experienced to habits that saved both their lives
Todd tossed inside but the reactions of transimission & gass 

Todd mid-air hips planted the drivers skull into the windshield

'ArGGRreh

He grunted stoopidly as the vehicle stopped dead in a bush
Other truck busy gathering-the-men caught in a mud-pit

The old-man too keen & had enough 
He opened the door & let himself roll safetly to grass

Todd took the truck hard twice
Old-man crackled in shock

!fucking-manual
!motherfucker
!gaddamngears

Todd threw his handsign
Right leg & hand moved independent
Truck lurched reverse & spun right towards his friends

Todd kept 1st gear till the house in roaring RPMS

Truck of rednecks first tended to the old man putting vengance to the side
It attempted to honk at Billy in the truck but he was no where to be seen

Todd's body screamed in pain of his previous ride 
He stopped outside the house & fumbled out in the manner of the old man

Ben took the wheel 
Jewels & Jordan hauled him into the truck-bed

Miss went work to patch up Todd & set back broken bones 
_

All the unfortunate events of the storm of the day had a silver-line
Todd patched up & able to rest in the cab of the truck
'No no I am fine
'Good here as anywhere

'We got a truckbed
'Lets haul all the books now

'Just pick out the good ones
Todd's last words before the concoction blotted conciousness
_

Ben under-estimated the quantity books his dad stole
Jewels busy massaging Todd's wounds with a balm as he slept
Pepper-balm-sand-clay-scub
Peppermint prepared leaves to layer afterwards
All coated by root-oil to encase Todd in herbs

Ben & Jordan went thru each box to filter all books into two piles
//////////////////////////////////
Fort Thickets to be made a study hall 
Themes laid for their destinations
Situations which augmented pursuits
A binge of activity in marathons
//////////////////////////////////

A tarp bound the buldged mass of books
First they stopped to drop Manda off
She was shaken with terror to a point she could only blame them

Jewels lifted Todd thru her window
Manda set her bed on some hefty books
This allowed Todd a place to recopuerate under her bed

Manda was a good friend yet their friendship came at a cost too-high
_

First they set down their section of the books using the tarp as a cover
Several trips would need to be made in sucession

Jordan kept chin-up as there was nothing to do about it
Dreading the mantenience to repair the trail afterwards
_

Jordan stood outside the glassdoors of the Library

'aye
! tack ! tack ! tack

Reluctant guard eventually came to the door
!4am 
!outtahere
!libraryclosed

Same guard from the years back
He turned making his way back to his lounge

Jordan yelled back
! truck in parking-lot packed stolen-book

Guard ignored him too tired to care
An hour & the involvement of the other guard required to get the guard back up

'Dude
'Im fucking serious
Jordan assuring him as he opened the door
'hella-books in a truck

Guard unbought
'Yeah & Yeah fk-off dip-shit 
'library closed

Jordan caught back 
'You dont remember me? 

Gaurd now woken complete
'Oh yeah I remember you
'I remember you stole from me
'After I fed you

Guard about to snap
'dick with me today... 

Jordan speechless-from-sadness disarmed the guard

Guard subsided to follow Jordan into the lot
Humbled by marraige to be receptive
His perspective habitually-wrong

! fuck
Guard-jaw-dropped
'That is a shit-load-of-books

Guard looked back in friendship reknewed
Redeemed from the sharp pains of betrayal
'You just got me promoted 
'Thanks Jordan

Jordan only able to nod & let the guard get busy

Reconciliation a comptemplation to keep him the nexst hours
The three packed the books they stashed thru the rabbit-path

Dark streets walking in a brisk
Something mechanical in his hands

Quick-glances to each direction at the corner 
He wraped a bungee-cord around the post

Mechanical device set on the cord to point towards the street
Lasers now scanned the intersection for traffic

Passing cars would trigger a recording in a feed-alert fed via WiFi
The feed linked to a screen banded to his arm 

6 of them set up
2 minutes of estimated reaction to prepare for police 

He crossed the street to verify the device
Arm-Band lit up with his potato-quality-image
_

Warehouse at the docks sat alone
Waves crashed at the corner of the open lot in heavy sprays

Network scans had this location in common
Location a matter of public inquiry

Yet he decided to ispect it before he alerted local news

Weeks to prepare for this night
Coiled ropes & cords flopped attached to the outside of his pack

Front the lot about to enter he made handsigns

'find the office
'find the gateway 
'hack the gateway

'Run this cable along the gate
'Set it up to the city-utility-connector

He turned & pointed to a green box at the end of the lot 

'The new cable will upgrade the connection
'Which I will tax slightly

He went forward in a rush of energy

'Keep tabs on my wrist
'When it lights up be sure 
'Nothing is missed

!show-time-muthrfkrs
!i-keeps-it-real

The late hour kept alerts down

The man approached the fence
'Probed an oceanside-window last-week

'Security checks up a few times a night
'No system to the timing

He walked along the fence after two-minutes with no feed

He only needed 20 seconds
Nike-Free soles molded to the fence
He jumped up & over in a fluid-silence 

Fences were his expertise
A preferred hurdle to deter chasers 

Movements direct & pre-planned
Till the base of the two-story office-building

He looked up to the window he probed last week
A loory alerted & passed 

He took off his pack & un-latched the rope
He achored one end to a thick pipe with a bowline-yosemite 

Window-ledge to a jump-hike got his arms to the ledge
An archor was found to pull the line thru for the rappel down

Quiet-movements swift in a flow
In Quigong breathing-techniques

Next feed-alert flushed with him against the window

He worked open a rusty window enough for his body to slip inside 
The window was shut & he let out relief

Inside smelled of a musty-warehouse
Office-quarters sectioned into cubicles

Family-portraits & anti-stress-toys 

He took a quick inspection of the floor & tested the locked stairwell door

Network lines were followed into a lock-closet
Whir of computers inside assured this was the location of the gateway-box

A pouch was removed from off the pack
Only after clumsy effort was the door opened


He removed a laptops from his pack
Powered-on & ready for the mission

A bogus label on the laptop
-DNS SERVER-
-KEEP ON-
-network will not work if off- 

New cat-x cable removed to attache the gateway-box to the laptop
He plugged in the machine & set it under the gateway-box

A new label was placed on the company-gateway
-troubleshoot
-check DNS server on
_

Gateway-box had a sticker detailing the network & the Internet Serice Provider

With that information configured into the laptop kernel there was no need to get into the gateway-box
Man-In-The-Middle attaches between two point & pretends to each end itself is the other end 

ISP->MitM->gateway
gateway->MitM->ISP

After laptop rebooted with new configuration

Ben woke from the dream & wrote it down 
A photo on a clerk's desk called out to him

Family around a sign on a sandy beach
~Pilgrims Pennesula
An icon of the characteristic-coastal-bay engraved

He recognized that part of the coast

Out on the Dunes spring time
Jordan out snorkling with Todd

Tide nice & calm 
Skaters waited their turn on the beach
Oranges thrown around 

! kingpin
Skaters greeted Ben
Clay Dorsey Javi & Homer

Ben joined them & caught an orange
He waited for Jordan & Todd to return
_

Jordan replied to Ben
'Pilgrim's Pennensula
'Never heard of it

Ben already drawing the shape with his fingers upon wet sand 
'The shape of the engraving put it just south of the Bluff

Jordan smirked
'Well thats the answer
'Not much of a vacation spot in this reality

'I been out there once
'Maps read it to be a NeverLand

'Miles from no where
'Fresh spring water

'I get there eventually 
'Shit ton of bugs
'Serious clouds of em
'blood-skn-whores

'10 min & done
'Back on the road begging a ride out

Clay didn't know how to place Jordan
Jewels was the bmx Legend
Ben was the kingpin-hacker to which even adults admired
Todd an odd-ball

Jordan normal as any kid
Yet he always spoke to an understanding next-level-astounding

All been up since last night
Water gleamed off round shoulders

Last night they got to boasting
Pull-ups essential for upper-body-strength 

Made a competition out of it
To go to the end & see where strength settled

Jewels was bored in the thousands

Pull-ups best eased into over time
Stretch mandatory

Jewels told them
~  Grab arms-distance over-head
~  Lay-out abdomen 
~  Strech as bow

~  Hold elbows over-head 
~  Lean right & left

Leaping over a fence happens hourly at night
Feeder-by-turns
One launch others jumping on others-skateboard & heaving-out-krew one-at-a-time
A soar x/1 of the time
Up in the air to glide to a place
Favoring the first roll over the skate-board & helmet then pack

Each in turn first to fly
Lauched with skank-out-as-flag

Next up would use flag to land & guide the rest
_ 

Jordan continued his story after he ate fruit-no-meat
'I get to Bluff
'hella-before-dusk

'Ready to bail back to the city 
'Set up camp & nighted

'Believe-me I could hardly sleep
'This place was Neverland

'Infinte places to set-up camp

'Soon as the sun went down
'Buzzes filled the air

'Swarm black against black night
'Worst night of my life

'Slept all night gripping shut my bag
'Bugs collided into sack all night

'A car would get suffocated by their guts

Jordan made a tsssss at Ben
'If you go out there
'tssss
'You dont know what I mean then

Todd felt a draw towards it
'We go tonight

Jordan face-back-attitude 
'Da-fk
'Only to troll bro?

Todd reassured him
'The full moon should keep the bugs-down 

Jordan palm-face 

Ben took up the challenge 
'I bet 4 supply trips
'The place once was landmark-tourist-attraction

Jordan took it
'Logically it would have been
'More ideal than the bay

'Bay took almost a century to clear out
'This would be ideal first-landing

Well assured of his future-free-runs
'Prob different in this existence

Clay broke in
'Dorsey you in

Dorsey declined
'Nah
'Chill at the beach
'Imma hit up Sabrina 

Clay settled it
? Out there that far you need bikes right

Members back down to their core 5
_

Out to the highway 
They dismounted to walk
Hitching a ride southside-oceanside-highway

An over-sized truck pulled over
Eager to make-use-truck-bed

Scratchs & dents marks of reputation in Texas

Man at about 50 wearing a decade-old truckers-hat
'Yall take trip this late
'Not much to do out our way

Jordan replied
'There is a party 
'Southside at the bluff
'Ben-here gots a date

Jordan nudged-openly at Ben
Call getting the old man's hoot

Travel-moochers must be good company
For-karmas-sake

Old man now jeered
'Throw yall bikes in da back
'Cab big enough
'yall come inside

'Pray someone gets laid tonight
'I aint got no possibility now
'Old-hag divorced me
'Took everything but this-her-truck
'Put this fine-lass in the PreNup

His meaty-hand slaped the dash hard proving-the-rig

Jordan always kept their packs in front when hitching
A good barrier & first-contact-pad if one had to jump-out

Old man cackled-loudly the entire time 
'Any particular place on the bluff?

Ben put in
'HEB 
'we need to get a few things

Oldman parked out-front-the-store
'Im just around the corner
'If I see yall again 
'I pick ya up

Jordan asked crawling down the truck 
'Can we get you a 6-pack

Oldman's eyes glinted
Hooting into the night

'Moonshine keeps my figure
_

Fresh supplies always hard-got
Stores hevanly place of plenty

Jewels gave props to Jordan
~ ace-hitch

Jordan smiled back
'Yeah that geezer was legit 
'We can scout a base & camp eazy-time-to-spare

'Wait till after dark
'If nothing then camp
_

Cashier looked upset by their selection
Obnoxious-in-cost & too-much-to-carry

Bandages behind his ears hid-tattoos
Black sleek long hair hid-the-bandages


'Those bikes yours out front
Cashier jeered at their bags

Ben fished info out of the cashier 
'There is a party here tonight
'Pilgrims Pennesnula

The worker started-up 
Oily thin strands of hair stuck-to-his-startled-expression
He turned & looked side-to-side then to face them

'Kay first
'never mention that here

'Kay idiots

He leant in closer all bro
'Tonight 

~at midnight yall
~is-gonna-be
~HELLA

Clerk sang into a low-whispered-dance
'Just keep on Jalisco
'Straight after the barrier

Deep-folds-of-skin on his neck leaked oily sweat
! it-gonna-be-tittys 
'So wassup girl 
'See-you-tonight

Worker appraised Jewels figure
Muscular legs in stockings & shorts
_

'A-holy-fk-this-wind
Jordan grunted a ways down Jalisco
Main street of the town to terminate here
At a straight-shot back to the bluff town 

Ben shouted up the bags anchored in such wind
'Better-than-bugs

Jordan yelled
'Stash sup & bikes

'Find a bush
'Eyeshot to that barrier

He pointed at the road-blocked steel arm
The gate locked off vehicles to the area

Todd chirpped 
'I wonder 
'What possibilities would have been
'Without that hitch

'So many random-events
'Create such drastic trajectories

Jewels faced him
~Or they 
~Drawn to us
_

Sting of sand brought packs-up to protect their faces

A mile & a half past the barrier
The end of the pavement terminated main road

A puddled dirt path led forward 
Each step more extreme

Tire treads scar earth
Mud pit after mud pit

No normal vehicle could pass the road

Jordan pointed to a hilltop
Lone it loomed over the bay

'Deer paths better
'than this shit-cake-show

Miss spoke out

'This part of the bay 
'Hit-gold round the 60s
'Karma swept it all away

Ground a gray-clay 
It clung with each step

Streaks smeared along their calves

Sand no-longer a blight to them
Wind blocked by the extreme up & downs of the passage

Jordan happy
'No bugs yet this path aint so bad
'Only got to carry a de-shitter-stick

Jordan gave an example as he used it to free the clay off his shoe in one movement

Jewels a nervous wreck to keep her Tome clean
A leather case protected the entire Tome

Thickets dense yet always with animal-traffic
Trails connected into webs of paths

Hilltop was visible most times

Miss stopped them with a whistle
(whiirp whiirp)

Jewels set her pack down to kneel
She gathered a bush of dense aromatic-herb
Clippers & twine Jewels made four sachets
(rare)
(good luck)

All wore a leather cord to drape-sachets 
It flagged them amoung others as distinct

Bags of dried herbs & charms for forturne

Todd regain strength commented
'This place aint so great 
'Even-without the bugs you hated Jordan

Rest toke & refreshments then they mounted packs

Up a steep hillside grabbing  thicket trucks to ladder up

Hilltop suddenly broke-away to panorama

Dark Corpus shoreline illuminated under moon

Great waves of the ocean hurled into near-by-beachs

Outcrops of dark boulders in the distance

Jordan lamented
'Buildings south-west 
'50 feet inland

He pointed 
'Off that barnacle outcropping

'I can see its form is definitely a rectangle
'You can see the straight shadows of the roofs

Ben 
'You should have known better to bet against me ole-boy
'How long you gonna survive if you bet against people like me
'Think of that on your four runs for me
'Computer equipment & the like

They set up camp in the sunset
Stitched-together mosquito-nets

Clouds now-only-parted after sunset
After they returned with the supply-packs

Jewels danced around serving her favorite 
Twinkis
~ feast all now
~ HEB way back

Jordan
'Even that hike was not difficult
'This may have been our most smooth adventure yet

Jewels smacked him back the head

Jordan recoiled
'muthrfkr-I-cursed-dam-it

Open hilltop enshrouded by the thickets 
The summit a small barren area able to see beach

Hammocks & tents set out secluded below the sand-worn-platau

Another fort that deer trails would only lead if the person knew how to read deer-trails

They left camp to head to the beach
Back on the road & down to the coast by 10pm

Jordan got them on a straight shot to the beach
Beach walking very easy to the distant buildings

~Pilgrim Pene... 
A sign half-buried-by-an-accumulating dune to the side

Ben pulled it out
'Exact same logo

Jewels
~trippy
Miss long-since asleep in her belly
Jewels woke her up with a burt

Miss burrowed her way up
Got set up all right
Then rapt Jewels on the head

All buildings degraded from decades of age 
All heavily-boarded as to block all entrance

Ben gave-up 
'To get inside any of these would require
'Half the building torn down

! vrooom vroom vrooooooooom
Trucks roared in the distance

Five back up the hill before any trucks neared
Hilltop at the Bluff overlooking a beach
A town named Pilgrims Pennesula was wiped from maps

Jordan acused Miss
'Why didnt you tell us
'Those boards are less than 
'the-fk-long-your-centuries

Miss 
'Hey a bet was a bet
'I like to see these things played out naturally
'You loser face is so cute Jordan


Five of them laid on belly at the lookout
In turn passing binoculars

! vroooooooom vroooooooooom 
Trucks illuminated the scene 

Tricked-to-legit-trucks caked-in-clay
Firewood netted in their beds

Each helped haul the other in a train connected by chains
Each pulled the other along in turn

They would reach the beach & unlink
Dunes were set up to run a lauch run

One charged fearless up the runaway and shot off the ramp
Rocks & sand sprayed as it landed then slid in a stop 
Jay-drifting it released nets that kept the truck-bed
Rocketing the loose-fire-wood into an accumulated mountain

Over 100 trucks arrived
Trucks all parked neatly single file

Light flickered in blazed of enormous bonfires
Buildings all operable in service

Booths of live animals
Fortune telling & street-magicians

Merriment wasted on alcohol

One truck haule a tethered cage open at the front
It would jolt off to lauch sacrifices in the cage deep to sea

First anchored-chickens then pigs then sheep
_

A great bonfire was built

Rites were made by robesman
Each took a vessel & a tube
They sucked out gas to fill the vase
Sacrificed gas in tithes to fire-pit 

Party-a-coil around the fueled mountain 
Summons audible on winds

A dark object arose from the sea
Long form drew the LochNess dragon

Large fins steeped to the beach
It approached the erected wood

A flash of a strike invisible to the hilltop
Lochness sniped half the body of a man
Which it flung up & crunched down 

In a great roar it stood upon hind legs
As it fell it bloomed a flame-lashing-as-wet-tongue
Aun hilltop shuddered as the creature landed

Fire-wood in a great blaze
LochNess returned to the deep

Aquatic-beings arose from the deep 
Dance drink & mate in merriment

LochNess head visible as it watched from a distance 

Tentacles foamed out into the shallows
From the deep abyss of ocean

Tentacles of all sizes yet all extremely long
'Miles long from a source megolithic past scape of view
_

Esoteric Order of Dagon robesmen rose from the deep
They joined the robesman around the great fire

Encircled the crowd from rackous into silence to chants

Odd-aquatic-hums of deep-water

Line hand-bound uncoiled towards the deep
Towards the outcrop of barnacled boulders

Men & Women in odd-orgy with the infinite tentacles
Sucked bodily pleasures by nipples on the tentacles
Enflamed arousal by electric-plup-sacks-soft-yet-firm-jelly

All unkoothe
Tentacles hairy in all types & color

Hair to strike whips into naked flesh
A prescion to expound pleasures hundred-fold

Distant human forms flung up into the air upon cum
Caught and cleansed thru waves by the god-like-appendages
_

Green glow lit the horizon
Believed to be illuminesent algae 

In time it drifted distict & apart
A single small orb drew all in a light
Light more a fog than a billiance 

Green glow pulsated hungrily in the feast

Emerald green orb folded into golden scales 
Set top a scepter in fine-ways of master-craftsman
A hermaphadite god enlaid upon it as crest

Impossible detail opened to Todd

Miss interrupted Todds deep-scorn
'It has met you

'Once the LOCHNAR chooses
'Always it kills or submits

'Orb of the Seer

'All my life it has never called to any but the Seer
_

Tentacles fkd-all-one-to-another as puppets
Rolls of flesh in vibrating unity

Foamy-scenes of garganteuam-enviornment
Sex smell thick in the air

Forms would come & go
Monstrosity flailed in the high-winds hours

Ending Cerimony with a chain of victims
Offered to the tentacles

Gripped to deep care & lust of the tentacles
Pulpus forms molding & humped aggressively

Foam spouted out of the orafices
Hotly layering the naked bodys

Great shocks of electricity sparked-arcs tentacle-to-tentacle
Air filled with wails of the deep pleasure of pain

Air now all hot in steam-of-it
Heat a sauna of sexual particles

Orb out-shone bright-green the full-moon

Each person in turn
Eminating in a frozen-form
Locked in a stasis of electricity
Awakened in full-bloom-of-lust
In that freshness devoured tastily
By a mouth that crunched in delight

Under hot-tarps mid-day till sleep available

De-camped over a light-fire for breakfast-dinner

Miss spoke avoiding the name of it
'Story only tales told 
'From any straight-line
'It can attract one directly

Todd admitted
'I saw it
'As if it was in front of me
'It lit up all as micro-moon
'Beams physically drew me
'Next to it to see closely

Miss continued
'I am stranger
'To that glory
'view-of-godhood

Miss spoke loud for all to hear
'Thru it the portals will open
'It will seek us & at that time
'We need to act upon it naturally

Jordan put in as reminder
To bring them back to more important-matters
'Just hope that our bikes
'Is where we left em

Jewels punched him
~curse on you
~rosetta 

Jewels hailed her bike a Mary
An action that ended in the kills of a pendant

Ben corrected Jordan
'last night was trippy

'So in any story now 
'Todd is the new buddah 

'Todd is either going to get skull-fkd-to-death by a tentacle
'Or we are going to get ditched in Todds leap with divinity

Todd in thoughts on terrific implications

On a balcony which overlooked the floor below

Government officals stood attent 
Children presented their impossible-discoveries 
Rings of power set in velvet boxes

Successfully tracked down against all odds
Items of legend to world-wide-press 

Attained by these children as if ring waited them

Other students honored & proud

Jordan's voice
'dont be sucker
'muthrfkrs are ganking you

Kid took the hint whole-heartily
Immediately before the boxes collected
In feint manuverd by Jordan
He re-lifted the LOCHNAR ring from the small box as he closed the lid

Green-orb reassured his palm with warmth

Officals promptly recited their routine-disclaimer
'You will have no more dealings with these matters
'Any attempt would be a loss of your family-line
'You service to this government will not be forgotten

Military Police escorted them out briskly
Cast-shattered faces of friends
So near to be his own situation
If not for that quick odd-thought & grab

Government all on the upper-floor
A swarm in relish of the spoils

Lowest to highest delighted in impossible spoils

Kid quick out at bottom level

'Hey I saw you
One of his mates ran up

'You didnt give yours
Mate shoved him back towards the second-floor
'You will get all our families killed

Undaunted the kid pushed ahead to outmatch-child-off 

Vengeful mate yelled
! He took the LOCHNAR

Typically ignored by adults & drowed in celebrations for all who knew that significance

Kid out submersed in the streets
LOCHNAR a trusted-friend after months

Rings of Power drifted as in wind
To settle on soil prepared by fate

He recovered several of the rings
Red-gem called to him in drunken-state
Gem in possession of several thugs

Thugs circled the kid's krew
'Heard you ask all around
'about ruby jewlery

Cocky kid provoked back
? You got it

Man flashed up into a rage at the bait
Courtyard in a rumble

LOCHNAR in the end subdued the thugs
Ruby jumped away under a night-stand
Kid knelt down to retrieve the ruby 

Out came a little spider

'oh sir oh sir

Gray of hairs in semblance of majestic mane
Coat of royal-anscenstry

Past midnight but sweating in the humid night
Texas out on the farmland decades since flattened

! CAR

Flat-lands allowed plenty warning to a car approach at night
Crew dove into a spot
Aided by the camo attached to their packs

Scotty tandem with his new girl
A bike he begged for
Jewels figured he was easily owed it & caved

~Bye Bye
'Sweet American Pie
Hum in the faith tonight they would lose virginty
Garden-of-magic a perfect place he promised

Kitty had perfect forms of breasts
Breasts hung heavily

All else under load 
Jewels had the Tome & mixtures
Firewood for Jordan
Ben had tarps & supplies,
Todd hauled-all-else using Jewel's trailer

Old one-pump-station marked the midway
Always visted on the trips to store up

Pack past it all dark & shutdown
Familiar smell grumbled Jordan's stomach

Jordan heartless had filled Todds-trailer
Now all would be thankful for it

Headlights noticeable for miles

Dark clouds would pass in the rapid bay-winds
Bright moon would fade to eclispes 

Contrast empowered Jewels to embue powerful spirit
At the hill her tools laid out on the grass

Soctty had all up in a stir with this sweaty work
Moon high when Scotty & Kitty returned

Aura bloomed into the maturity of satisfaction
Ultimate satisfaction of naught-else-higher

Scotty iceberged the Titanic of awkward
He explained holding Kitty who bashful

'Kitty there are several states they call it
Scotty counted them down for her

'Brew state would give powerful dreams
'Smoke state to inspire them before journeys
'Balm state calm them to deep meditations
'Edible state would purge them before fast

Jordan ventured freely
'Due to the feminine-lure of drugs
'We five are often blitzed in those states

Jordan shot at Scotty
'Remember that time with the waffle-maker

Scotty wouldn't have that without a lesson taught

Jewels imediately filled the vacancy next to Kitty
~ Miss go to sleep

Miss startled
'Well now her me before you give me a bed tiMe...

Jewels stuffed Miss down & into stomach
Jewels looked that the awestruck Kitty
~ tell me

Night worn on and eventually krew got Jewels prepare a faggot
	weed, flowers, dried herbs
	weed, driftwood, dried-sea-plant
	honey, leaf, tabacco

Jordan's bonfire raged into a deep slumber of red coals
Jewels set the cone & they all drank her tea

Ben's tarp formed a Tee-Pee around the fire & circle of bodies

Hot-boxed-together around smoke  wind came from all directions
Smoke randomly passed onto each in time

Vibes resonated vibrance of a spring night
Kitty blushed to awe her state-of-being once only imagined now lived 

She took Scotty across the lake again
Cat unabashed to follow & creep from the bushs

Scotty one lucky ginger to have deserved her
All sexuality perked a crowded hill-top 
Kitty fk-else-fks-loud
Fingers into the balm Jewels snuck her
Spread over her nipples & then her clit
~oh the good ole it-out-in-out

She sang in a pleasure of pain which erupted Jewels in a seizsure of laughter

All went to work to maintain sanity & give privacy

Jewels out among the plants

Todd chewed a cluster of mint & cane cross-legged 
Acomfortable desk kept here to write atop 

Jordan out below in the shed engineering a new device for the pool
It would allow a leakage of water to generate energy from a pipe to continue on as clear spring

Ben on his laptop powered by local-solar-battery he first read logs
Much of the time spent in generalizing logs into ambient ideas
Clouds of interactions which he worked to pipe more intelligent

Mountain-top in snow-caped Asia
Teen on a trail-run up the ridge

Path of it only difficult & narrow
Death consequence of mis-composure

Night put this path impassable
Aun no place to sit
Little clue on the correct path down

Slopes all drastic & divergent
Smoothe to prevent retrace on this maze

Ancestors kept this vale sacred
Journey for the boldest-of-heart

Mission to fill two buckets
With the sacred supply to present to goverment goons
Their villiage was enslaved

'In this reality everyone
'Is a slave

Male sensitive to the moods of the passanger
'A lone mountain spring
'Drip by drip by drip to a small pool
'Large enough for these two buckets

Steel rungs of each end of the staff attached the buckets
Sturdy iron-wood-staff laid in steel & gold
This sacred relic allowed to be non-stripped
Symbol of the subjection & servitude
Aun of their mountain god

'These fools know little of us
'This task used to train our hero

'One prophisized to free the people
'To never fall to the pits of the spring

'I have yet to fall in the pits all these years

Week after week trails to train him in destiny
Paid too good to stop no other bold enough
Every runner has died without exception

This movement his art as expressions outlet of opressed-existence

Out here naught could lord him
Out here he king of the world

World as far as eye could see
Trail could break over the ridge
So it was stay in this desolate place 
Until you decide to return back to a meal
Before night came 
Todd amazed by the mastery of complex movements

Hip train warm-ups the vital key
Low to the ground made the path safe 

Buckets anchor points
Movements instinctual as kung-fu master
Todd instructed to deep learning

Animal forms applicable to the present obstacle
Camel Crane Monkey Russian Mantis Drunk 

Staff balanced on his neck he clasped his palms
Handsigns swiftly-executed 
Aun a dab of precious olive-oil 

'Slavery will not break me
'Here subjucated as all

'Here I am your master
'Aun You purported powerful-being
'Tho more blessed you sure to be
'Aun I lowly slave
'Alive to beg

'Life in pursuit of simple mastery
'When all else gone

'Tai Chi Qi Gong
'Breathe in
'keep your center
'Breathe out & move

'Extend or contract
'Breathe in & keep your center

'Staff a double-polar-end 
'Stable four vector anchor

He tightened one hand & pulled with the other
With a whip of the back, the steel ignited against a rock

Once proud boulder now chipped-off a good chunk

Todd was then able to speak
'I am of a tribe of Corpus
'Five of us live as nomads

'A comsic deity known as Dagon
'Will consume all possibility connected

Todd felt the lump down his throat

'We are fated to lose
'Then to kill his-image 
'For another demension tasked to kill him

Slave responded
'Always in dealing with fate
'Correct answer always to fight fate

'The LOCHNAR has chosen you
'A power which when recieved will empower all
'Act the night of moons-green-glow

Dont caught a tight terror
He said nothing of LOCHNAR

Slave continued to fill his buckets
When buckets were filled
'Time to end the summons
'I never summon & trek

Todd braved out
'I can get you over the ridge

Slave cocked back
'Alright pal well unlink to you that may seem like a good idea
'But to me that means succed or die all-in-from-the-start

'Passangers always act to rashly

Todd promised
'There is always a trail
'One to the top of the ledge
'20 meters above the spring
That is a deer trail

Slave shot back
'There are never deer in this valley

Todd put it simply
'Then up there is your proof
_

Dusk of mid-autumn night
Bayside school tricking over shit
Jewels catching her breath
All else in hopes to talk to her
Crowd by crowd has stopped during the day
Not one of them chose to leave yet

All teens released from school
With nothing else to do

Scotty met other dealers & they powwow dealt
He would hustle edibles Jewels made only at a high price

'Dese my friend
'For that special night
'When all needs to be right
'I promise you
'This will take you out of misery
'& Into a lande of pleasant pastures of plenty

'fk-off-mormon
'go sell a cunt
Skater-dealer scoffed tho did not remove his gaze
'how long they good for

'Scotty dont you worry about that
'Jewels that girl, yeah her
'She perdicted you would need them soon

'Hell even strangers know that about me
'They tell me everyday

He handed over for two

Skate-pack stayed 
After the posers & wanna-bes left

They were rich kids from the south
Two groups skaters & the dealers
From the same school of spoiled-have-plenty

Leader darkskin-glinted-in-sweat rolled up
He managed to give Jewels some impressions

'How about dem Black & Mild 
'Abe 
'Put that rotation yo

Jewels shot back a tip-of the head
Standing aside her bike
Her smile a big-flash-of-white

The tallest one, an asian, spoke up
'We all go to Carol

'We hit a few spots after this one
'The ones that close down after dusk
'No rent-a-cops

He passed Jewels first the wooden-tipped cigar
The smoke let out in a thick cloud
All reeked pleasantly of tabbacoo-strong-mellow-odor
_

Hot summer breeze of salty air 
Sweat drained-unending off forehead & back

All chill hid behind a building 

A short one said
'You should amatuer for Miller
'You are that good 

Jewels counter
~do it for love

Jewels let off an expression of tenious
13 Now light-headed weary state reknewed

The short one braved a question
'What is your worst fall

Then a few more
'Can you kick-flip-180-brake
'What do you do to get hops like that

All answered spaced thru the next 6 hours & three spots

Herd of fearless near a mob

All rolled up a fatty 
Then hit two more spots on the way to a friends

13 Bodies piled into a room, living-room, garage
Dead-tired & able to pass out on anything

Dealers had pieced home
Only the skaters there inside

Four of them mad bed around band equipment

The morning was a sweep
Step-dad triggered

Tired each parted after that
To some place they didn't want to take the pack

Meet up spots eventually found to meet-up later

Ben passed out a few usbs
Several were connected by the end of the day 

Time for a lazy afternoon ride to a spot
Crash-out wake up well-after-necessary
.
.
.
Dagons Eve was the day they decided they must take action
Then the powers were sure to converge at the University Hospital

Till then they lived life as it presented itself
East Texas mountainous hills river-length on tube

Remote strechs only take on horse
Lunchtime at a particular ebb

Jewels picked plants with Jordan
No tail just wandering with foliage

Passage that suited them best
To a small valley between trees

A lily flower
Powerful to a wiccan

Grew lone on a perch
High & unstable

Unreachable cept for her abnormal strength
Up-top drew in more curiously
Signs of wiccan conjury apparent
Left after decades of lonliness

Satchets attached to trunks of trees
Idols & tokens to ward off others

Poisonous thickets & large-maned-spiders
Wild cats hissed there revealed a harem 

Nest of the felines in the groves of a thick marijuana bush
Signs now led Jewels on a search that would not end until the 
Cave discovered

As if by magic
Over a slight hump of nasty poisonous thorns

World now a peaceful mellow meadow
Cottage to the deep rear 
Great well of water out front

She found the back ways not used for much time
But used for much longer as to give natural way

Three after time worried increased by shrooms 
In marshmello & colors kelidoscope they passed

Shocked aun in their state at the sight of a witch's cottage
Smell of aromatic herbs proved the truth more than sight

A snake of great lengths uncoild from around the decrepit door
Slithered to the bushes to the rear to watch from a distance

Jewels obvious witch
Crows cawed others to view approach
Tome greater than any heard
Caw of which will echoe here-fore

Witches are all drastically-different
Yet their common themes astoundingly apparent

What this witch built lasted in a cute-beauty
Preserved only the better for the wear

A large cauldron over the kitchen hearth
Great-beam of sun shown down
Four all could easily look up to the sky
Ceiling high & sustained by an old-pecan
Chimeny great & anchored well
Rear-double-doors suited to barrow out the ashes

A island-table boulder lay flat & stable

Trapped triggered
Arrows flung & whipped-roots-lashed
All poisonous 

~FEAR A WITCH
~AS SNAKE
~AFTER DEATH

Message carved over the slab that released the traps
Poisonous after all these decades

Jewles & the krew all minor-severe
Plants out front clean out the wound legit

Jewels in a lust ran off after ointment

Jordan asked confused
'da-fk wit her

Ben saw
'Every witchs grave
'Is another witches treasure
_

Jordan manange to aid the place
Placements of splices of thorns
Now made for only two passages
Too large for a grown-adult

Todd directed his Kung-Fu to the energies of the field
Learned the lessons of the soil & rocks & root

Ben hacked away at something or other

Jewels remained in awe
This a palace no less the dunes

Granted the dunes had ancient wealth
This place pure dedication of one-woman

Spirit now thrived as Jewels invigorated presence
Tabacco will bring many to partake

There then conversate
Jewels & Witch

Audible-ghasts-aun-boys-hear
Miss would not come out in fear

Jewels made proper burial of her bones
She died of tumors working till the end

Pyre built & lit
Ceremony of passing

Tomes of Jewels now had two sides
She passed her sisters celestial
In the manner of bright flame
Under full mooon

They got rides by friends & never returned
Friends as theirs expected nothing less

Pack easy to stay a while
A day then supplies ran out
As well as their stomach for pecans 

Jewels always kept pouches of oils & spices & herbs
She could make anything delicious until then

Wild herbs & pecan salads 

Line of Felines trained on point to their duties for Jewels
Principals passed down genereation to generation in royal line
Now that mixted over generations with great many stray lovers

Cats now able to run basic things
Water plants 
Debug here
Pick & dry & store here

Chores cats tho distracted constantly 
Managed eventually to complete
Even if one act took a week

Mice population so strong only the idiots
Were the daily price of the felines

This part of the forest supporting 
Hundreds of thousand mice

Royal guard mice
Had to win against a cat
That means scar a cat

Then they are renamed after the cat
Mice are excellent spies
They know everything

Other mice mock the scars
When a cat is tagged a fool

A new mouse gets nobility
In the wordless ways of mice-speak
.
.
.
Ride back in a truck
The guy didn't speak much
As if obligated to take the crew

Back in Corpus by morning
They were stuck 5 hours midway

Come of the highway to the crashing coasts of the bay
Next days only light sun & chilly relaxation

Moonshine now the rave there at their private-party
This blew-up the underscene with Ben usb traffic

They installed his kernel
Used it as a source to communicate
Each part of the other

A TOR snowball of clock-work traffic
End-to-End OTOPSK encrypted-packets

Network now unable to be stopped

Need-for-Privacy overtake the entire network
Each computer a bridge to the network

What Ben had in mind would only insure the inevitable
On Dagon's Eve he would re-do the entire network
It will work to well than to revert back to a fix

Entire region to-be the most secure place to exchange information
End-Game for Ben

His characteristic image now a symbol of revolution anti-society
Code proven to be unbreachable to any impactful degree

Hours & hours poured into creation of the unix-kernel-build-world
Simple methods of verification & encryption techniques all cloned 

Ben's network is connected to by most devices
Login to share data totally secure in an automatic setup
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Workplace gossip near single-handed destroyed society
Friday only a mornful day to many remembrances
\\\\\\\\
Authorities first openly declared it an easy example win
Frustrated they had to conceed difficulty to the public
This all the rage for the streets world-over
Code passing as if on global winds to all hemeshperes
It was just a better way to net thru society

A DJ came in
Lots of regions from the crew
Opened it to the all
Creating a bridge

All the krews 
Over the entire city
Had time to type it up

City still kicking-it all came here
The party was wild & it lasted for many days

The last man standing never left
Still on that hammock every-night over the cliff

Jewels spiked a potent haze to the drink
Alochol multiplied the effects

Aun who frequented immediately forever-lost how to find this place

But Ben signed Titties & had a supwerstar night
Todd & Jordan & Jewels couldn't not be envious
Especially Jewels who was expected to have attention

Party named USB 
USB or you dont get in

Ben had the cats all run a usb thru dd-machines
Before he fed any for the night

They all left with a different usb
System preloaded to kick off if plugged in

Ben was dawned the White Rabbit
Pick-of-the-litter adorned with floppy-ears
Gave a sloppy-suck to king Ben crowed in carrots
Crown due to Jewels quick humor & action
Spectation the climax of the twilight-night

That night a legend of which many of its forms would echoe
Always each spring-break out Padre Island
Carrot King & Bunny was somthing only locals understood
'Follow the White Rabbit
Accompained the thought
.
.
.
Library outside middle-school kid sat
He was talking to some older-smart-kids

They only listened politely
Tho their facial-expressions wouldn't suite

Charles said to them
'Dreams
'Dreams are quantum passages to other worlds
'In dreams I seen things that dont even exist as concepts

Silence only answered
Boys waiting for their rides to arrive

'Think what you want but chew on this

'Matter can not be created nor destroyed

'All great men stand on shoulders of giants

Boy last to get picked-up

Jordan went over
'Yeah you are right
'Smart brain you got

The mom arrived & the boy couldn't reply

Dagon Eve holiday was a region-wide
Open-celebration at the capitol bay

Ritualistic sacrifice
Pigs or calves roasted
Carved as one of the members of the group 

Accompanied by a feast of much more
All out in the streets with pits

Walk down the bayside ways to try morsels
A happy-time with never semblance of violence
All harsh times were blown off & settled as a mass

One cam of age here when one realized in a shock
What the day's celebration really meant

This the Eve of Dagon
A preparty meant to be bigger than the party
This year discovered as victim to arrogance

'special
An unspoken foreboding

Children would all pack up
Mobs of them at a time

If a child tagged you 
'special

They would in waves attack whoever tagged 
Vengeful best keep docile & let them have their fun
_

No one missed Dagon Eve on the bay
But this night they would use that to break-in to the University Hospital from the school
They would enter how they exited 
From there they would take the elevator upward

An overrun alley was perfect to tarp the bikes
Rustle of chains brought the attention of police

PoPo blupping in demands for attention thugs of society
'Yeah your screwed give-up night-ruined

They always moved in packs like waves

'Hey what you doing back there
Lights hit them imediately

Crew lifted each other over the wall onto a parking lot of levels 
_

Another set of cops already chasing the crew up the levels to the last

~hey-get-da-fgaaa-away

~hey timmy
~you got them called out breaking that window

There was a scuffle in a tried action to penalize the comment

~oh shit 
~hey its Jewels

Immediately the personality of the pack of skaters hid up on the highest level
No where to go & the PoPo would eventually discover & trap them

First an inner group whispered upon accordance came up with a plan
PoPo just shined lights out from the layer under

Cop cursing
~if that bitch gets chosen 
~these brats are gonna pay

All in one voice 10+ yelled
'SSSSPPPPPPPPPEEEEECCCCIIIAAALLL

Children are especially violent to cops
Most cops too stubborn but even that hardly mattered

Special cops were a death-sentance
This cop would erreously brag he alone survived

Shit-pants in a flight for life out to get-the-fk-out

Same crew we always ran into
_

Ben shouted over his shoulder as they left
'Tell everyone pings x 1000 12 hours tonight  

Themselves taken as crazy to turn down their way to the bay
Stopping to show off a trick one of the noob-freshmen broke a window

Alerting cops to the area
_

Bikes were checked on

Jewels
Graced Mary
_

Thru the window as if they passed thru it every day since
First stop was Jordan's locker at the extreme end of school

They talked - not quiet- on the empty halls
Sure this place was deserted

A light sprang on
The four froze

'I heard some-tin
A giant shadow clambered about

A voice far from the light muttered
'Dagon Eve
'dim 
'whit

The shadows warped the head as if it so tiny on an enourmous torso with diapers
.
.
.
Jordan whispered angrily
'gdmit-fk-it
'told yall shut-the-fk-up

Ben brushed it off neceissarily

They arrived at the locker & Jordan forgot the past entirely
Entirely as well discarding the present
Panda Bear ravished out in middle hallway
Others never quite getting enough space away

Dusty panda now tied in a rope-hug around Jordan on his back over his pack
'girl i know you missed this
Jordan said coyly in a very out-of-character disagreement

Way down to the closet without incident
.
.
.
Jordan struggled at this time than at any in his life
He submitted to the handsign & was then able to work-it-out
Locks on the closet door opened one after other

All-too-familiar hall as if time here remains constant
Streaks of blood painted out in great stains

The girl who shit, the girls with periods that week, along with many patients
Died when tracked down the aquatic-monsters
Dragged here and consumed all-else falling to feed the hive

Body parts in small-pieces saturated the musty-tunnel with a morbid-revulsion
_

Todd went first now having learnt his lesson
He would wipe then climb
He wiped a way for them to the higher floors
One each only after the other arrived

10 Floors passed only after trial
Two legs anchored out helped the climb

Without idea of what to expect
Crew acted & worked over any obstacle

All had their usb & made clones as they explored the offices
The corner offices were the most interesting

Each could easily pick the locks

Next, openly-argued as the most important stop
Ben tilted led the way to the closet

For his algorithmn to work
This old code must have accomplished
What he with an army of hosts could not crack

The long passage drew sweat to Ben's brow
All kept their distance
Ben this anxious to flip his shit

Ben opened a door to a corner room
Darkness felt out only an empty printer

The code was either defunct or the answer thrown away
Ben flipped-his-shit the printer flung here
Then it flung there

Until at last & eventually landing on a soft thud
Fall softened with a layer of paper

Ben lifted them up
Aun dark the closet the white paper revealed
Patterns he programed

Hundreds of them
All papers in the same form

Ben knew each one of these was a repeated key
His most grateful desire was now accomplished

He gave each of them a stack of the papers
'Guard these with your lives

Ben updated their USB each as able helped Ben's dream
30 Mins & Double-checks he reworked the kernel
Redistributed with the network-root 
To used the survelient-system against itself

Key salted to a higher level never to be cracked
Method now used only OTOPSK salts to exchange data
Nodes updated & already building unix-kernel-worlds

Toggable network accessed by ease
Launched from this platform entirely secure
_

The LOCHNAR seen in a picture of a penthouse-view

Miss instructed
'That is the highest floor
'I have only been there once
'There lies a great terrror


That was all she would say 
Rue of fates hand dealt

To preserve strength they took the elevator up to the penthouse
Ben hacked in and recommanded the wiring to all them up

Despite an initial drop
Ben swore would never have been fatal
The doors opened up to an enourmous suite

Penthouse cieling as if standing under the ocean itself
Dark tinted oddly shaped glass roof

A great pool of water laid out in a thin pool
White sand lay in the center as a lone island

LOCHNAR resonated a green light that hummed in energy

'Miss so you have returned
'With Jewels the Treasure of Ebb-ave-lee

A form on the sand which seemed warped drift wood
Sprung to life in a silent slither under the water
Up to the sandy bank

Todd meant to position himself closest to the LOCHNAR
He took a forward stance to the left for a flank

The creature hissed all too quick for them to get a look of the form
'Prophecy calls Jewels here for sacrifice

A flash dove at Jewels 
Frieght-train shut down

In full halt
Painful for so great a creature

Its form now laid out in a broken mass

Todd now clutching the scepter of the LOCHNAR
To fulfill prophecy
LOCHNAR obiedient slave
Shrunk to a swallow only seen by Todd

All else captivated by the form
Shoulders of an oxen yet aspect of whale
Tentacled arms long & barnacled dangled-loosely 
Ink drooled past embarassment from sides of lush lips the liquid color of coral

Moments later a dart shot out of the room
It came from the shaft in a blurr
The long dash Jewels weight countered
Todd & Ben held in a grip

Todd held the creature at bay
'You will not be able to go after them
'We will kill you if you break grip

Two boys tore at it in fervor to respect

Pepper-bomb quickly incapacitated the creature 
Jewels dropped the creature a 
~double-wide-fk-off

Each nose in a mucus crusty & bloddy 

Todd croaked out
'Go go

Ben cried out in a throw
The MASTER-key-usb thrown to Jewels

It was over the creature was horrendous
The fight was over

Only in the brazen exposed all-in
Arrogance led to its downfall

Todd & Ben had time to admire its evil
Holding the creature long enough for Jewels & Jordan to long-since-escape

Face front a dark panorama of ocean 
Fresh gusts pouring thru drifting white sand
_

The beast composed of a chain of torsos
Ribcage & Arms stiched in muscles as a snake
Sets upon sets of arms each with steel gloves

The bottom of ribcage wout feed out the neck connected to the next-ribcage
Skin of it a milky-softness of a new-born the rosy aspect of it unsettling

Nose were grown on each shoulder
Noses sniffed in individual-character
Extermely interested in as much as dogs

The sitching required to form such a creature done with fine-precision
The arms held them securely but the heavy-metal hands out-of-situation

Each of the nails was painted differently in a nacissistic finesee
Each limb of the monster grip a machine vice

Lobster-claw bit hard into Ben's thigh
Jules cracked that shell against Tome

Arms moved & acted independently
But the whole driven as a catepillar

Puffy-fat face done-up by too-much-makeup
Creature twisted entire body in swirls
Trampled it crawled up the wall & into the dark

Great creature knocked-out was found gone
They were vacant top the penthouse

Darkness covered all aun starlight
No inch visible in thick darkness

~I have seen you in dreams

'muhaHaHAH

~As nightmare to nightmares
~Sacrifice of Five

~Feed

Darkness began to sway movements thick as water
Backs to each other await the first attack of much movement

Darkness cleared by hammer-head sharks
All formed behind the Tome 

Hard as bulls Jewels was charged
First knocked her back in catapult to the other three

Each hurled to themselves
Tho far they landed softy as in water

Countless movements gave way to dodge the hurled humans

Todd fell in a roll forward 
There was silences until he moved

True silence revealed engulfed in the whitenoise of great mass
Tiny fish engulfed him more than a swarm of bees

Todd protected himself in a ball
Fish chewed but immediately bailed

Crab spider scuttled at Todd
Joy in consuming mouthfuls of small fish

Cherry red spider with a sharp black crustation
Fangs of thick saliva glowed to reveal its terribleness

The decision to not eat Todd apparent
Spite he bled into the thick air 

Spider made path in a feast as top-predator
In a leap it poouced on an octopus constricting Ben
Massive tentacle sniped off by the spiders pincers

Ben lifeless yet Todd saved his life 
Great gasps as a shameful whimper escaped him
He embraced Todd in lost gratitude

Unable to understand the situation Ben followed Tood
Octopus puss out after the loss of a tentacle

Jewels strip naked & held electrocuted
Many long clear flosfloresant pink tentacles griped each part of her
As breath the mass of jellyfish would sink the shocks

All would go from pink-glow to white lit
Jewels lit up in great wide of agony

Spider shot out a thick-web-line as a whip
Broken one part of the web put the jellyfish out-of-sync

Spider, Ben & Todd all held destroy or drive-off the jellyfish
Each carried a shoulder draging her weighed down by the this air

Todd  yelled
'We must find Jordan
'We only leave together

Spider led them to the vent which continued to run to the roof
Ben agreed & would not make a move towards it

Spider turned fiercely to Ben shot out a leg to pin his leg & lunged
Before anyone could act the spider fell forward in a writhe of pain

'sk-my-stinkies-yo 
Jordan crawled out of the shell

Down vent with a passed-out girl 
Todd able with newfound strength

Two floors down they broke out onto the restroom
Decided to risk the elevator & it paid off
10th Floor they crossed over to find the dummy-waiter-vent
They made their way thru the hallway of the school, out-the-window
Back to the industrial hideout
The locks & chains securing them rest from over-exhaustion

################################################

Only now the creature recovered from the bomb
In a whip Todd was thrown into the aire
Todd landed in the water in a great splash to his good-fortune
Ben grabbed by all hands busy prep surgery

Torture of the reconstruction unable to reveal the location of LOCHNAR
Taken by Jewels & the traitor Miss

Both lower half of body severed
Brain Removed into his check
Eyes repositioned on his hands
Other eyes attached in an array
Nutrients fed in a tube no mouth
Connected to Todd each end other
Three rows of arms distance away
Middle which contained the stomach

Stiched together by careful-expert-ancient-hands
Beings as slave for simple-purpose-and-exactness
Beings warped by circumstance into sub-human-life
Devoid of vocal expression & chained in-line
.
.
.
Todd spoke
'Faith is belief

'Faith in sacrifice
'For elevated states

Green glowed off orbs
Eyes window to soul

He dropped down
Past Jewels 
Between her & Jordan

His hands caught rope
Swinging his mass to pendulum against the wall
He kicked Jordan into the shaft

By the power of will echoed thru LOCHNAR
Todd seared the cable

Todd spoke
'All too clear
'The order needs Jewels
'Humanity needs Jewels

Swiftyly the two vanished into the darkness as creatures pulled them up

'Faith is chosing a door
'That must not be open
'Prayer to shift it along

'unspoken leader
'i admit all guilt

The yells came down
With a fullness in scream
Rips apart throat lining

The rapid descent of cratures down the tunnel
Drove Ben & Jordan to their only route

Back up to the third floor

! SHHEEEBOOOOOOOMMM

A large mass with a little head as oxen drove thru the wall
Bloomed in a dust-cloud of purple-prilgrim brick

A Centipede shot out thru the clouds exposing a host of evil 
Parts of man enginieered to mechanical-means 
Arrays of limbs & crafted buldges of muscle

Skins microscopic pale scales oozed oils
To shine-of-any abnormal appearance as inhuman

Tentacles dripping is orgasmic juices
Masses of plupy slugs crawled overhead leaving acidic trails 

'fk-u-Todd
Jordan then lashed down
